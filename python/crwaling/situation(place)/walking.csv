How did you get so pretty
I don't even mean
When you're dressin' up
I mean when you do
What is special to you
Your smile is my favorite make up
I cannot believe
That I get to be
Makin' memories
With you in my life
Tastes sweeter every time
I'm a better me
'Cause I'm feelin' free
Like a reverie
But it's really true
That you are really mine
Will you be mine forever
Will you be my only girl
I will be yours
Through the thick and the thin
Our love will make
A beautiful world
I'm workin' hard to be a man
Who truly knows and understands
That there is more to love
Than feelings
I'm taking time to study you
To see your colors and your hues
I know there's beauty
I'm not seeing
I cannot believe
That I get to be
Makin' memories
With you in my life
And that is worth the grind
I'm a better me
'Cause I'm feelin' free
Like a reverie
But it's really true
That you are really mine
Will you be mine forever
Will you be my only girl
I will be yours through the
Thick and the thin
Our love will make
A beautiful world
I will be yours forever
I will be your only man
Can you be mine
Through the thick and the thin
And I can be your number one fan
Will you be mine forever
Forever you and me
Will you be my only girl
Will you be my only girl
I will be yours through the
Thick and the thin
Our love will make

헝클어진 머리가 내
눈을 찔러
거울 속엔 검은 반달이
내 눈 밑에

다시 한걸음 내디뎌
지루해 나 이제 변하고 싶어
라고 느껴질 때 한걸음
무기력한 하루살이로
더딘 쳇바퀴로
지는 햇살 뒤로
거울에 먼지는 쌓이고
나는 생각이 멈춰버렸다
난 뭘 하고 싶을까
살짝 열린 문틈 사이로
잠깐을 바라본 그런 탓일까
어딘가 날 이해해 줄 사람도
있을까 싶어서
돌렸다
더 이상 못 걷겠다는 생각이 들었을 때
다시 한걸음 내디뎌
괴로워 이제 그만하고 싶어

단어로 표현하기엔
할 말이 많던 사이
벅찬 화를 참기엔
아직 서툴렀던 아이
지금보다 화려한 서로를 위해
지금이 추억이 됐으면 해
널 더 찾지 않을 때
웃으며 얘기했으면 해
행복한 끝말잇기였었다고
못 이어가 안달이었었다고
붉은 실로 이어져 있다던 우리
얇고 가는 면을 좋아해서 깊게 우린
라멘집에서 합정 한 가운데에서
약속했어 미래 과거까지 다 보듬어주기로
근데 why u actin ruthless tho?
한번 끊어진 건 이을 수 있어 다시 또 내 생각
해줘 난 니 생각중야 매일 밤
red light pointing at my heart
나누던 생활마저 끝말잇기 같은 거라 봐 나는
네가 하나뿐인 이유였다 봐 사는
끝까지 갈 수 있냐는 말에 난 가능
하고도 끝의 끝까지 가자는 말하는
that's a word chain 내 목에 걸게
다음 도전을 받아들여 선택
아쉬워 난 추억으로 남기에
늘어난 테잎을 다시 감아 run it run it back
come 여기 home don't let me alone
come 집안에 갇혀진 air balloon
미동 없는 phone 붙잡고 하루 종일
입안에 말을 잠가놓고 한숨을 온종일
창문을 통해 보는 불꽃은 아름다워
화려한 추억 말이 좋지 죄다 끝난 거야
갤러리와 음성 녹음은 다 지겨워
마지막으로 마주 보고 말하고 싶어 I luh you
널 더 찾지 않을 때
웃으며 얘기했으면 해
행복한 끝말잇기였었다고
못 이어가 안달이었었다고
oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh oh
행복한 끝말잇기였었다고
입버릇처럼 달린
위한다는 말은
눌러놨던 마음을
말하기 위한 포장인걸
이제 와서 보니
티 났던 속마음을
차마 못 털어놓고
입만 바빴어

내일은 뭐 하지 또 여자를 만나고

되감기와 재생만 누르는 24시간
내게는 너무 당연해
친구는 말해 여자를 만나야 해

그래 나도 동감해 하지만 음감회
같은 곳에서 만나는 
인연을 꿈꾸는 내게
일반적인 건 무리 술병을 줄 세운 뒤
사진을 찍는 여자한테 매력 못 느끼지

술집보다는 전시회
아니면 알라딘에 가서 책과 CD에
대해서 얘기할 소녀가 필요해
아까 본 만화책 속에는 있던데

숨겨져 있단 걸 알아

피폐한 삶과 더해지면

똑바로 보인다면 맘을 가린 타협이

둘째 우연한 만남을 기다려보기
세 번째 연예인과의 사랑을 원해
팬과 연예인 아닌 보통의 연인의 관계

벌써 날 비웃는 너의 모습을 보니 
현실엔 역시 나란 녀석이 
안 어울리는 듯해
핑크 빛 우주 위를 떠다니고 싶어
그건 내 환상을 의미해

하루를 살고 있어
현실은 낯인데 난 뒤척이며 
별을 찾고 있어
상상하는 것은 자유인데 날 보며 
혀를 차는 거야 왜 ?
환상 속에 그녀가 나타나 준다면 
평생 널 지킬텐데

너는 어떤봄에 살고있어
어떤 색깔들을 닮아갈까

가자 너의 내일로
우리 여름까지 날아가자
그 4월속에 네가
꽃들이 될 것 같아
내가 너의 봄에 살아갈게
우리 항상
벚꽃 나무 아래서 만나
세상에 너없는 봄이 온다면
예쁜 꽃잎이 다
피지않고 지나갈걸
우리 하루엔 너로인해 웃는 내가
걸어가고있어
사람들은 너를 사랑한대
너의 파란색깔 봄 바람을
세상 속에 떨어진
너의 색깔로
가자 나의 내일로
우리 여름까지 날아가자
그 4월속에 네가
꽃들이 될 것 같아
내가 너의 봄에 살아갈게
우리항상
벚꽃 나무 아래서 만나
니가 그려주던 봄이 가고
내 여름속엔
텅빈 햇살이 감싸겠지
내 4월속엔 네가 있어
벚꽃 나무 아래에 이젠
나의 봄은 없지만
내 맘에 간직할게"
16,Falling,유학파,"Baby I don't wanna tell you a lie
이젠 뭐를 해도 쉽지 않아
또 밤에는 잠 못 들고
오늘같이 술에 취한 밤
지난날들을 그리다
이제야 알게 된 거야
티 낼 수가 없어 no one knows ay
기댈 곳도 없는 세상 날 무섭게
사실 말하고 싶었어 I'm not okay
안 좋은 생각들이 머리에 가득해
날 알아 달라고 세상에 소리치던
그런 날 못 견디고 떠난 너도 가끔 미워
지겨운 위로 뒤로하고 오늘도 니 밤을 빌려
Good night 하루만 쉽게 잠에 든다면
Without you 무너져 또 이렇게
남겨져 아무도 모를 곳에
Falling to you
Girl, I'm falling to you
Without you 숨조차 쉴 수 없게
떠올라 떠난 니가 괴롭게
Falling to you
Girl, I'm falling to you
세상의 전부였나 봐 5평 남짓한 공간
모두가 다 떠난 뒤 뒤처진 거야 나 혼자
니가 선택한 길이니까 전부 견뎌
I told ya i never switchin' sides 너넨 할 말 없어
손잡을 누군가 darling
누굴 못 믿어 하나같이
다 져버린 거야 사실
도망친 거야 난 사실
어쩌면 우린 다 다른 듯 비슷할지 몰라
보낸 뒤에야 깨닫고 뒤늦게 빠진 혼란
익숙해지면 처음에 소중함을 다 잊고
마지막이 마지막인 줄 알아 다 잃고 나서야
가벼워진 머리로 하늘은 본 날
처음 본 별들은 빛나고 있던 거야 혼자 oh
그만할게 이런 생각
Good night 하루만 쉽게 잠에 든다면
Without you 무너져 또 이렇게
남겨져 아무도 모를 곳에
Falling to you
Girl, I'm falling to you
Without you 숨조차 쉴 수 없게
떠올라 떠난 니가 괴롭게
Falling to you
Girl, I'm falling to you
Without you 무너져 또 이렇게
남겨져 아무도 모를 곳에
Falling to you

Without you 숨조차 쉴 수 없게

30,3월을 기다려 (Valentine Girl),이달의 소녀 1/3,"막 추워지기 시작하던 어느날 
우리가 첨 마주쳤던 어느날 
그때부터 내 맘이 그랬어

어색해 눈도 잘 못마주치고 
인사 한마디에도 말을 더듬고 
돌아서면 답답해 했어

소심하던 내가 떨리는 손으로 
큰 맘먹고 건냈던 2월의 Chocolate

oh boy- 내 맘을 다 꺼내 담기엔 
너무 작은 상자였죠
진짜 반의 반의 반도 안돼 
그래도 느꼈다면 내 맘을 알아챘다면 
내가 다음 달을 기다려도 되나요?

지구가 더욱 느려진 걸까? 
이번부터 2월이 길어졌나? 
왜이리 맘이 조급해지죠?

혹시 내가 너무 부담을 준걸까 
괜한 고민 속에서 하루를 보내요

Oh boy- 내 맘을 다 꺼내 담기엔 
너무 작은 상자였죠 
진짜 반의 반의 반도 안돼 
그래도 느꼈다면 내 맘을 알아챘다면 
내가 다음 달을 기다려도 되나요?

그대가 날 부르는 목소리 
사르르 달콤한 이 기분에 
혹시 꿈일까 헷갈리기도 해

근데 이러고 아무것도 없음 안돼 
어제랑 똑같음 안돼 
그럼 내 맘이 많이 복잡해져 
그러니 이번 봄에는 그대의 맘을 보여줘 
말 보다 달콤한 그댈 기대할게
진짜 다음 달을 기다려도 되나요?"

언니 방 서랍 속에 졸업앨범을 보다가
3학년 1반 반장이었던 그 선배를
오랜만에 보네요

농구스타처럼 멋있었던 
그댈 보는 게 그렇게 좋았죠

1학년이던 내겐 선밴 하늘 같아서
말 한마디 건네기 너무도 어려웠죠
두 살 차이 뿐인데

노트 한 권 가득히 채운 선배 이름 세 글자
전할 용기 하나 없었지만
이름만 봐도 설레던 나였죠

결혼은 했을까, 혹시 내 이름 기억할까
그 동네에 여전히 살고 있을까
키는 거기서 크긴 했을까
이 좋은 기억으로 남길래 그래서

시간은 내 목을 졸라
내 삶에 의밀 찾고파
흐릿한 안개가 내
시야를 가린다고 해도
온몸에 화살이
박힌다고 해도 못 막아

난 누구보다 살아 있어 하루를 시작해
렘수면 상태 나의 꿈은 비밀
그걸 이루기 위해서 짐을 지지
I'm wide awake

113,Feel Good Too,Jason Mraz(제이슨 므라즈),"You, you are a wanderer
When you walk into a room
It's like we've landed on the moon
You - you are a dreamer
When you walk into a space
You make believers
If it makes you feel good
If you're excited
If you really want it
And you cannot hide it
If it makes you feel good
Then go on let it
And go on get it
‘Cause if it makes you feel good
I feel good too
I feel good too
Feel Good
You, you're a bit of mystery
And I'm still buzzing 
from whatever it was you did to me
Yea, You. You got moxie.
And I love it 
when you're dancing right beside me
And If it makes you feel good
If you're excited
And you really want it
And you can't deny it
If it makes you feel good
Then go on let it
Go on get it
If it makes you feel good
I feel good too
I feel good too
I feel good, too
You're often misunderstood
Some people just wish they could
Do what they want
F'ing the shoulds
Just go enjoy your life
Stop trying to get it right
I'm celebrating my time that's remaining
Working or playing
I'm spending my savings
Like we're on holiday
Do the things that make you feel good
We're on holiday
Do the things that make you feel good
(Feel Good)
If it makes you happy
It makes me high
If it makes you laugh
Then it makes me smile
Do what you want and don't be shy
You make me feel alive
You're an inspiration
A work of art
Congratulations
You won my heart
Do what you love and everybody feels it
I feel good too
Do what you love and everybody feels it
Feel good
Feel good
Feel, feel good
Feel, feel good"

Delete every number from my phone?

You loved me to my face
You lied
(And now it's all gone away)
And you say
You needed me
But you lied
You're the one

While I bleed
Maybe we weren't meant to be
Just two star-crossed lovers in
An endless sea
We drown
Another one just bites the dust
We were Romeo and Juliet
If Romeo was never inThe stars aligned and
The fates allowed us to be
Everything and nothing all once
Another one just bites the dust
We were Romeo and Juliet
If Romeo was never inI'm calling out to you
Why don't you hear me now
I've got nothing to lose
You bring me down
(Although it hurts, I won't cry)
We've
Been chasing a dream
It isn't what it seems
Cuz
Maybe we weren't meant to be
Just two star-crossed lovers in
An endless sea
We drown
Another one just bites the dust
We were Romeo and Juliet
If Romeo was never inThe stars aligned and
The fates allowed us to be
Everything and nothing all once
Another one just bites the dust
We were Romeo and Juliet
If Romeo was never in love
I feel so broken right now
Somebody heal me, I'm losing all feeling
The ghost of you keeps on haunting me
Still see your face
Can't walk away
Hey, you
Do you see me now?
All the damage you've done
Hope it comes back around
These wounds will heal
And I'll smile again
But back when
The stars aligned and
The fates allowed us to be
Everything and nothing all at once
Another one just bites the dust
We were Romeo and Juliet
If Romeo was never in love
Like Romeo and Juliet
We fell apart

She'll say it again

Oh Jenny won't you let me be 
Oh Jenny you got me on my knees 

Don't look back
She'll cover your eyes
Blindfold
Jet black

She spins you around and round like that
Go stand in line if you'd rather forget
You're no more than friends

She keeps you posted
Pull the strings
Until you find out what she's missing
Mmmm

She's always listening
Now you're trapped inside
Addicted to her mind games
Mmmm

You do it again
You do it again
Another regret
But you play pretend

She'll say it again

Stare at self portraits til I cry
Take it away
Take it away
Just take it away

Where I sit and write my mind
Don't take it away take it away
Don't take it away
Wish you could see what I see babe
Before it really is too late
I know sometimes it's hard to take a step away
If I could gather some words to explain
It's almost like light shines through your pain
Emotion I never knew awake
But at the time I didn't know
One in a million things you showed
Straight from your heart miles apart
Who was it for?
I got something like a funny feeling
Stare at self portraits til I cry
Take it away
Take it away
Just take it away
A cafe terrace gleaming in the nightime
Where I sit and write my mind
Don't take it away take it away
Don't take it away
I wouldn't say I have misfortune
Cuz there's nothing I would change
I'm just waiting for my moment
But is it in vain
And every piece that I've been painting
Should I throw them all away
The night cafe
Flower vases
Bring me pain
I wrote my pain to what you hear
But I know that they don't care
But I know that you don't care
I'm sorry for whatever I put you through
It's not easy putting down
All of your love on a canvas
But you
I got something like a funny feeling
Stare at self portraits til I cry
Take it away
Take it away
Just take it away
A cafe terrace gleaming in the nightime
Where I sit and write my mind
Don't take it away take it away
Don't take it away"

I try not to overthink
That everything happened to me lately
There's nothing wrong with me life

it's in the little things that make a difference

didn't know how lonely this life could be
I regret the things I said about family
cause it's hard to
figure it out
all on my own
so no

it doesn't feel the way like it used to
staying up late
nobody to talk to
till the morning comes
and the feelings rewind
can't sit and pretend
it's easy living far from home

when I go out and make friends
it's tough here in the deep end
there's so many complexes it's draining

this new chapter in my life
is testing me but im fine
I'll come out of it with a new perspective

didn't know how lonely this life could be
I regret the things I said about family
cause it's hard to
figure it out
all on my own
so no

it doesn't feel the way like it used to
staying up late
nobody to talk to
till the morning comes

it's not easy living far from home
nobody told me how to cope
im struggling but I'll make it through

You were gone from my side you left

Among here what is the thing that you loved?

Not really much to do
So that's when you creep into my
Thoughts and visions
like postcard views
I know it's a lame excuse
but here’s to wishing you, were
here

To all of the tears
And to all the good times too

I'll be missing you
And you would think I would know it by now
Tha(t) you and me will make up to break down
if my heart could choose
I would have you pull up underneath the street light
Get into it all night
Reminiscing on /our time
Our time our time
Our time our time

I know better the feeling won't last
Drawing me back into the past
Tip toeing on the border line
Cuz something stupid probably ended it all and
I dont play and you’re too stubborn to call and
I can't remember
why we fell out of love
but I damn sure can't forget
when you were
here

I'll be missing you
And you would think I would know it by now
Tha(t) you and me will make up to break down
if my heart could choose
I would have you pull up underneath the street light
Get into it all night
Reminiscing on /our time
Our time our time
Our time our time

So if we gave it up
Does it mean we gave it up
Forever
When I gave you all my love it was really love
Worse or better

Our time our time
Our time our time
Our time our time
Our time our time"

I can be anything when I am in this mood
It can be anything you don't even guess
I'm getting blue
I'm getting blue
I'm getting blue
I'm getting blue
Everything is BLUE
I'm in the Blue Blue mood
BLUE feel like I'm colored blue
Anywhere I go and see are Blue
Now I'm sinking in the blue without you
I'm in BLUE
I'm in the Blue Blue mood
BLUE feel like I'm colored blue
Anywhere I go and see are Blue
Now I'm sinking in the blue without you
I'm waving waving
Deep inside of dark blue ocean all alone
Already sinking sinking
I think I need a little tank full of air
You never know what it is to be a like blue
I'm gonna keep my heart the other side of you
And gonna sing the blues alone inside of me
Then all the lonely feeling ready to be bloom
I can be anything when I am in this mood
It can be anything you don't even guess
I'm getting blue
I'm getting blue
I'm getting blue
I'm getting blue
Everything is BLUE
I'm in the Blue Blue mood
BLUE feel like I'm colored blue
Anywhere I go and see are Blue
Now I'm sinking in the blue without you
I'm in BLUE
I'm in the Blue Blue mood
BLUE feel like I'm colored blue
Anywhere I go and see are Blue
Now I'm sinking in the blue without you"

Recalling that day when you said goodbye

I miss you miss you more than words can say
The way you way you left just wasn't fair
But I'll keep walking through the pain
Hoping somehow you'll still be there
Maybe someday we'll cross paths again
And we'll pick up where we left off
Until then I'll keep moving on
With memories of you deep in my heart

But tonight I'm sleeping at my place
Not the one to kiss a stranger
And suddenly your whole mood changed
Where did mister charming go?
'Cause now he's acting crazy
Cry cry baby
Never been rejected by a lady
PS I don't owe you anything
I don't owe you one damn thing no
PS I don't owe you anything
I don't owe you one damn thing
It's funny how you think that I wanted
So I'll remind you case you've forgotten
PS I don't owe you anything
I don't owe you one damn thing
PS
I sell the spoon you come from wait
Now I'm about to boost your ego
You think you got me on your plate
But baby I am not that naive though
Where did mister perfect go?
'Cause now he's acting crazy (So crazy)
Cry cry baby
Never been rejected by a lady
PS I don't owe you anything
I don't owe you one damn thing no
PS I don't owe you anything
I don't owe you one damn thing
It's funny how you think that I wanted
So I'll remind you case you've forgotten
PS I don't owe you anything
I don't owe you one damn thing
PS PS
What did you expect from me?
A love letter?
If you wanna get to know me
Then you better
Tell it to the next girl
That's not how you get by
Acting like I'm next in line
PS I don't owe you anything
I don't owe you one damn thing no

Mouth full of gum
In the driveway
My friends aren't far
In the back of my car
Lay their bodies
Where's my mind
Where's my mind
They'll be here pretty soon
Lookin' through my room
For the money
I'm bitin' my nails
I'm too young to go to jail
It's kinda funny
Where's my mind
Where's my mind
Where's my mind
Where's my mind
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fate
My v is for vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache
Everything I do
The way I wear my noose
Like a necklace
I wanna make 'em scared
Like I could be anywhere
Like I'm wreckless
I lost my mind
I don't mind

Why even hesitate this time?
Thought you could prove me wrong
That people get along for life
Nothing left to hold
Pockets filled with holes
Safer to say it than breathing in dust
I'll clear the air for the both of us
Don't over think it it's just giving up
February came and called it enough
We tried to make it work
Pretend it didn't hurt this time
But you just won't confess
That this is for the best I'm right

Long nights first touch last kiss
We're in that same fight you're right admit
I'm afraid that we're gettin' too good at this
Forgettin' who we are
I don't want those late nights
Long drives in your car
To get in the way of our big dreams
That we shared in the dark
What if we want somethin' different?
What if we're better apart?
Before we take it too far
Maybe we should leave it as it is?
'Cause it doesn't get better than this
But we don't know when to quit
'Cause it doesn't get better than this
Happy tears then I'm feelin' sad
Best and worst that I ever had
I don't wanna see us end like that
You talk I hear you speak
But I don't hear a thing
It's always I try you cry so I
I'm afraid that we're gettin' too good at this
Forgettin' who we are
I don't want those late nights

What if we're better apart?
I think it's time that we talk
Maybe we should leave it as it is?

Best and worst that I ever had
I don't wanna see us end like that mm no
Ooh what if we walk away? (Mm)
Ooh what if it's all a mistake?
What if it's four in the morning
Regret in bed and upset it's too late
If we never leave it
We're never believe it
I don't want you to get over me
Gettin' over you gettin' overused
Gettin' over me gettin' over you

177,DANCING ON A CLOUD,HONNE(혼네),"Let me take you through the moment
When I worked out you're the one
I was feeling hopeless
But then you hit me like a home run
Living in the shadows
And now it feels like I'm in for some
And if love was a game of one
I do I do I do
Take you take you take you
To be my morning noon and night
And I knew I knew I knew
That you that you that you
That you'll meet dizzying heights
I'll be dancing on the cloud
Thirty thousand feet above the ground
Cause that's how I feel when you're around
I'll be dancing on the cloud
Thirty thousand feet above the ground
Cause that's how I feel when you're around
I feel light headed
Is it 'cause I'm way up high
Or maybe 'cause you say
I could be your guy
I was living in the shadows
But now I'm floating in the sky
Love is a game you should try
At least once in your life
I do I do I do
Take you take you take you
To be my morning noon and night
And I knew I knew I knew
That you that you that you
That you'll meet dizzying heights
(Yeah that's right)
I'll be dancing on the cloud
Thirty thousand feet above the ground
Cause that's how I feel when you're around
I'll be dancing on the cloud
Thirty thousand feet above the ground
Cause that's how I feel when you're around
I'm not afraid to repeat this
I'm lucky to call you mine
I'm on no cumulonimbus
I'm up on cloud 9
As long as I got you beside me
I know that I'll be fine
Right now
Until the end of time
I do I do I do
Take you take you take you
To be my morning noon and night
And I knew I knew I knew
That you that you that you
That you'll meet dizzying heights
(Yeah that's right)
I'll be dancing on the cloud

189,Our Summer (Acoustic Mix),투모로우바이투게더,"타오르는 태양 아래 질척이며
녹아가네 회색빛의 빌딩 숲
끝이 없는 기말고사 뒤척이며
잠 못 드는 잿빛 도시의 소음
한순간 나타난 너의 환상
마법같이 빛나
부서지는 파도소리 너의 웃음
내게 손 내밀 때
눈앞에 펼쳐진 건 우윳빛 은하수
피어난 금빛 계절 Like our summer
어디에 있어도 어떤 계절에도
우리가 함께라면 Feel like summer
싱그런 너의 향기 반짝이는
너의 눈빛 내 맘 일렁이게 해
현실은 힘을 잃고 지구조차
숨죽이고 순간은 영원이 돼
뜨거운 태양 아래 너와 난 이젠 우리가 돼
회색빛깔 도시 위로 푸르른 파도가 쏟아져
눈앞에 펼쳐진 건 우윳빛 은하수
피어난 금빛 계절 Like our summer
어디에 있어도 어떤 계절에도
우리가 함께라면 Feel like summer
가을 겨울 또 봄이 온대도 우리 함께면
황금빛 모래 여름 바다 위 뜨거운 태양
그 속에 영원의 약속이 찬란하게 빛나
상상한다면 계속 믿는다면 네가 있다는 걸
눈앞에 펼쳐진 건 우윳빛 은하수
피어난 금빛 계절 Like our summer
어디에 있어도 어떤 계절에도
우리가 함께라면 Feel like summer"

바람이 불어들 때
가슴 아팠던 날들 기억을 타고 와 
스르르 미소가 되지

도로를 타는 불빛들 그 사이에서 
너와 듣던 노래들
지금 어디에서 뭘 하고 있을까 
우린 life goes on

흔하다고 해도 있는 그대로를 
전부 믿고 싶던 그때의 나를
후회한다 해도 이젠 잊어야 해 
돌이킬 수 없는 시간마저도

변해가는 거리에 다시 불어오면
잠시 손을 흔들어봐 
이루지 못한 채 멀어진 꿈들에

어깨가 닿도록 걷는 저 많은 사람들
모두 어디로 향해 가고 있을까 
멈춘 계절은 언제쯤 널 데려올까

그리운 너의 목소리 들려올 때면 
차오르는 한숨이
그땐 왜 그랬을까 참 나약했던 내 모습 
자꾸 그려져

변하는 게 너무나도 겁이 나서 
너를 도망쳐 왔어

여기까지 와 이제 좀 알 것 같은데 
네가 없는걸

눈물을 배우고 아픔을 알고서 
미소 짓는 법도 알게 됐지
너도 그랬을까 한참을 앓고서 
내게만 보여준 미소였을까 
돌아갈 수 없게 멀어진 yesterday

바쁜 하루하루에 널 잊었다가도 
그런 매일매일에 순간 웃어봐도
잠깐 밀려온 기억은 한순간도 날 
그대로 두질 않아

시간이 흐르면 내게 다 하지 못했던 
그 한마디도 너를 향하던 마음도 
잊혀 질 줄만 알았지 계절이 가면 

아무도 만질 수 없는 기억의 바람 
변해가는 거리에 다시 불어오면

Among my friends in second grade class one
When I was a shy girl
You said hello to me

At the yard during our lunch break
A ball was flying towards my face
Suddenly blocked the ball and asked me if I was okay
I wish I could go back

Time machine up we go
I wanna go back in time and go to you
Back to the night of our beautiful school trip
you and me made a pinky promise

Colors of the rainbow
They're shining like the light of the Milky way
We are now grown up but in love at least
It'll be so beautiful and blue
like the sky 

Late at night at the school festival
We looked beautiful in the night sky
You played a joke on me and tried to hold my hand real tight
I wish I could go back

Time machine up we go
I wanna go back in time and go to you
Back to the night of our beautiful school trip
you and me made a pinky promise

Colors of the rainbow
They're shining like the light of the Milky way
We are now grown up but in love at least
It'll be so beautiful and blue
like the sky 

Inside your beautiful memory box
Are we still shining bright
As before

Like the chocolate that you gave me in my hands
Wanna go back to that classroom break

When we bring up our memories
Before I know it I'm right there by your side
When someday, when I will miss this lovely day
It'll still be beautiful like now
As always"

Do you like it where you are 
Do they treat you like a star
Do they sing for you the songs 
you always liked

You’re scared of all the lies
All you want is a sign 
Telling you where to go
There’s no other way to turn
The only lesson you learned
is to never forget 
your way back home

I love you love you love you

Love you love you love you

그래 네 말대로 다 해줬잖아
그런데 뭐가 또 그리 불편해 불쾌해
날 보면 쉽게 풀리게 돼?
팔다리가 아프다 해서 데려다 줬잖아
원한다 했던 거 다 해줬잖아
뭘 원하는지 모르겠잖아
날 원하는게 맞는 건지

Dirty water
Days are shorter
Nights are longer
I wanna be the only lover
That makes it worth it
Pulls you under
From the surface
They've been talkin'

And I heard that your boyfriend 
now wants one of his own
And I'm too drunk right now, 
if you call I'ma pick up that phone
And I heard that you're out on the town, 
yeah I know how that goes
When you can't break away from the ties 
and you dip in that dirty water

In my system
Summers under
Blurry visions
I wanted to be out the shower
By 8:30
And go to work
Not feel dirty

And I heard that your boyfriend 
now wants one of his own
And I'm too drunk right now, 
if you call I'ma pick up that phone
And I heard that you're out on the town,
yeah I know how that goes
When you can't break away from the ties

But you know I won't as long as 
I go deeper to the ocean floor
Find another lover at the liquor store
Dip in that dirty water"

Two hearts, electric and eager
One touch and I'm a believer
You got me coming all undone

Baby, I'm confessing
Like how you undressing
It could be a blessing if we do it right

If you keep it up imma see the light
Open up the gates to my paradise like

Taking me to heaven when I feel you breathe
Singing like an angel got me on my knees like
My God My God Oh My God My God

But you know the way to unlock me
Render me tender like a lamb

Nothing compares to the feeling
Surrendering to your healing
I'm melting in your mighty hands

Got me falling for your power
Hot and sticky in the shower
Hallelujah say it louder
I just wanna be ya-
I just wanna be ya, be ya

I just wanna be devoured
Hot and sticky in the shower
Hallelujah say it louder

How ya doing?""

I moved on, couldn't be better
Happy and light as a feather

We're not together (Okay)
And mostly, I never remember
It's all in the past
When anyone asks
I tell 'em, ""It's no big deal""
Not everything lasts, it wasn't that bad
That's probably how she feels (Hmm)

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna forget her
There's always some pain with the pleasure
Yeah, yeah
Plus we ended on good tеrms
So it could work
I won't ever say nevеr
It happened so fast
I'm not really mad
That we couldn't make it work
Not everything lasts, it wasn't that bad
Yeah, I didn't get too hurt
But when I get back to my room and I shut the door


[Chorus]
Everything hits me at once
I know that you're not coming back to me
It's not enough
Just knowing this is how it has to be
Then when I'm laying alone in my bed
You play like a broken record in my head
When will it stop?
I know that you're not coming back to me
And that's just how it has to be

[Verse 3]
Well, ""Hello!"" I sent the message
Haven't seen you in a minute
I'm talking with you and everything's changed now
But for some reason nothing is different
It's you I have been missing and I wanna say it
I know it's a bad idea
Yeah, you let me go, I already know
But maybe I need to hear
How you did it, what's your secret?
Was it easy?
Was it harder than trying to make it work?
Was it awful? Did you hate it?
Did you barely had to put in any work?
Was it worth it?
Would you do it again or would you not even consider it at all?
[Chorus]
And everything hits me at once
I know that you're not coming back to me
It's not enough
Just knowing this is how it has to be
Then when I'm laying alone in my bed
You play like a broken record in my head

When will it stop?
I know that you're not coming back to me

And dream you see the world like me
But then I wake up
Bring myself back to reality
I've been trying oh to see what you see
But some things never will make sense
Least not make sense to me
Oh I wake up and I got these issues
I don't understand
Go to my mother she's an angel
Swear she got a plan
No oh oh I'm not alone
No oh oh I'm not alone
I find a place inside my sweatshirt
It's my favorite place to be
'Cause the world inside my head
Still beats all reality
Sometimes I close my eyes
And dream you see the world like me
But then I wake up
Bring myself back to reality
I've been trying oh to see what you see
But some things never will make sense
Least not make sense to me
Oh oh
Baby it's mama
Um it's 10:35 on friday
Wanted to see if um
We could try to connect this morning
I just wanna hear how you are
Um I wish we'd actually just stayed
On the phone last night
'Cause I want to support you always
Uh give me a buzz sweetie
Bye"

Trying not to spiral

Reading all the signs slow, I look like a psycho

Stuck inside this cycle of yes, maybe no

왜 감출 수가 없는지

대본에도 없었던
고백을 해버렸지

대답이 없는 너의 표정은
누구를 위한 연출이었는지
웃기라도 해준다면
이상한 애가 돼도 좋은데

소리쳐 이름을 불러 볼까

너의 미소를 빛내줄 수만 있다면

너 땜에 내 맘도 간지러
억지로 애를 쓰지 않아도
또 너만 보게 돼
네 두 눈은 봄의 햇살 보다 빛이나

사랑인가 봐 생각도 못 했던 이 봄이야

착각일까 왜 그럴까
답답한 일상을 벗어나고픈 걸까
이 봄이 내게 준 선물인 걸까
믿기지 않지만 믿어 보려 해
우연은 아닐꺼야
묘하게 모든 게 다 예쁘게 보이는 봄이야
사르르 내리는 봄비마저도 포근해
거리에 날리는 꽃 잎들 보다 더 많은
사람들 그중에 내 눈에는 너만 보여
사랑인가 봐 생각도 못 했던 이 봄이야
봄이야 별거 아닌 일들에도 설레이는 봄

And your ghost it
Lingers in my head it wanders
Aimlessly to corners I wish to forget
Like memories of late nights and red wine
Like the way your body glistened in moonlight
And the promises we made but never kept

Couldn't see the sun behind the clouds
Wondered if it'd ever come out again

Nineteen candles out before we kissed
Nights of my youth hardly missed
But I say whoever wrote this story
crafted one hell of an arc
The bits of me I couldn't stand
are my favorite parts
Never used to take the time to recognize
Everything I need is right in my line of sight
And I don't know my destination
but I've come to learn

Do a thousand takes and pick the fifth
Get overwhelmed by every little thing

Remember being a kid and wild and free
Playing Rapunzel from the balcony
Thinking I didn't care how you'd see me
Good day
Yeah we're sitting on a park bench
in the thick of spring
I write these words and watch the daffodils
sway in the wind
Never used to take the time to look around
Pay attention to the different layers of sound
It's so funny
how we run to where we need to be
That we never get to take in the scenery
I don't wanna live my life that way
I look up to the sky
I know the world is mine

I'm so so fucking grateful
We took the long way 'round
Been in the lost and found

272,Just Friends,Virginia To Vegas(버지니아 투 베가스),"Remember your apartment
when you said
You don't wanna
waste any more time
On let downs or heart breaks
Now we're day drunk
in the back seat of a taxi
And you're telling
me you wanna kiss me
But we shouldn't 'cause
we're just friends
Maybe we could
go get lost tonight
At least we'd know
that we gave it a try
So why don't we go out
and get a drink in the west end
Smoke a cigarette
and talk shit about exes
Take a couples shots
and see where the night ends
Stop pretending
like we're just friends
Why don't we go out
and get a drink in the west end
One more dance
are you feeling the tension
Take a couple shots
and see where the nights ends
Stop pretending like
we're just friends
Stop pretending like
we're just friends
Stop pretending like
we're just friends
Tomorrow when
it's over and we're sober
I just want to believe
that you'll miss me
But I shouldn't 'cause
we're just friends
Now we're day drunk
in the back seat of a taxi
And you're telling me
you wanna kiss me
But we shouldn't 'cause
we're just friends

Now I'm driving home on dopamine
My brain is in the back seat
And my heart's in drive

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm holding onto every word you said
Don't take it back, no

[Chorus]
Don't stop, baby, don't tell me that it's over
I can't take it, I'm shaking on the sofa
You know there's nothing like you and I together
'Cause when we touch, something in it moves me
I swear to God, it feels just like the movies
(Feels just like the movies, oh, it feels just like the movies)

[Verse 2]
What if we take the night?
Walk around, talk about it
Get in a fight, you know I hate it when you run and hide
What if it's wrong, baby, what if it's right?
What if it's love, baby, give it a try
Don't take it back now


[Chorus]
Don't stop, baby, don't tell me that it's over
I can't take it, I'm shaking on the sofa
You know there's nothing like you and I together
'Cause when we touch, something in it moves me
I swear to God, it feels just like the movies

275,don't wanna be your friend,joan,"Two AM I'm freakin out
Heard that you were back in town, well
I don't wanna sit through coffee
Feeling like I'm out of body
Every time you come around (come around)


Cause it starts off with small talk
Yeah it's always the same
Say you wanna start over
I don't really know how to say this, but


I don't wanna be your friend
I don't wanna just pretend
Can't forget about the things that we had
You just wanna act like
You don't take a part of me
Every time you turn and leave
Hurts to say it
I don't want it to end
But I don't wanna be your friend


No it probably sounds too harsh
But I don't need another scar
I hate how you turn it on and off like a faucet
Now it's floodin and my mind's getting lost in
All the memories of feelin so еxhausted
And what could've been, I'm not over it, so


I don't wanna bе your friend
I don't wanna just pretend
Can't forget about the things that we had
You just wanna act like
You don't take a part of me
Every time you turn and leave
Hurts to say it
I can't do it again
Cause it


Starts off with small talk
Yeah it's always the same
Say you wanna start over
You don't really wanna hear me say this, but


I don't wanna be your friend
I don't wanna just pretend
Can't forget about the  things that we had
You just wanna act like
You don't take a part of me
Every time you turn and leave
Hurts to say it
I don't want it to end
But I don't wanna be your friend

I don't wanna second guess
What's going on inside your head
Playing back all the memories we had
You just wanna act like
You don't take a part of me
Every time you turn and leave
Hurts to say it
I don't want it to end
But I don't wanna be your friend


I don't wanna, wanna be your friend
I don't wanna, wanna be your friend"

Hold on, I don’t wanna know what

I don’t wanna move on
I don’t wanna know what
it’s like when you’re gone for good
You’re slipping through my fingertips
A little bit by a little bit
I didn’t know that loving you was
the happiest I’ve ever been
So I’m just trying to hold on
I need to learn how to cope without you
I'm tryna protect myself
but only you know how to
Yeah ohh I know what
we’re supposed to do
Ohh but I hate the thought of losing you
So I’m just trying to hold on 
Hold on, I don’t wanna know what

Starting to feel like you don’t need me 
Wanna believe it’s all for the better
It’s getting real
I’m missing you deeply

The dungeons and the dragons,
I just asked them not to breathe on me
Shit get difficult then shit
get nasty in the easy E

If I move to mars
If I move to mars will you come with me?
If I move
If I move to mars
If I move to mars will you come with me?
We can find a small spot of land
Build a house with our hands
Make the walls from imaginary plans
Lay the rug you love right across the floor
There'll be no concrete or corners at all
And we won't even need a closing door
There won't be a lady we be paying daily
Just to stay maybe
If the neighbours ain't complained lately
If I move
If I move to mars
If I move to mars will you come with me?
We can take a mixer and cables
And both my turntables
Couple crates of my best white label
And space oddity and dark side of the moon
We can bring the cognac that we been savin'
For an extraordinary rare occasion
We can lie in the dirt speaking not a word
Looking up at earth
Just be one with the universe
If I move
If I move to mars
If I move to mars will you come with me?
If I move
If I move to mars
If I move to mars will you come with me?
'Cause I just want you
To be with me too
Yeah I just want you
Oh and maybe 80 million ks to anywhere
I want you

Save me, save me, save me
Slowly can you

My jewelry got good manners, 
chains compliment my ring
3 cribs and no cars yet but Imma drive the Benz
I talked to God 
the devils not makin' no appearance
I ain't been on the road but I'm still pavin it
Last album was 2019 I'm still out here rakin in
They say your 20s are for fuckin up 
I'm out here celibate, now

I wrote this when you're pissed off
Never meant to say so
Ready for another fight?
Just send me location

Thinking I'm moving too fast
Baby you're stuck in the past
I ain't gon' lie I saw you leave
And I lost focus
When I was there I didn't care
And you took notice

322,Problematic,BoyWithUke,"Her laughter's for another, 
her motions are disguised
Her make-up doesn't cover 
what I see behind her eyes
Yes, I know that nothing's wrong, 
but what's the harm in asking why?
I know that you're not tired. 
Where the fuck were you tonight?

Baby, let me be
Take my noose and set me free
Light my home on fire, 
take me higher than I want to be
Baby, on my knees
Begging for the sweet release
Let me hear the choir full of liars, 
tell them I want peace

I wish I wasn't problematic
I'm semi-automatic
I'm trying not to panic, panic
I'm burning bridges into ashes
Light them up like matches
How could you understand it, -stand it?

This morning she skipped breakfast, 
said she was running late
Her actions turning reckless, 
she began making mistakes
And I noticed something off 
about her cadence yesterday
She didn't even notice 
that she called me by his name

Baby, let me be
Take my noose and set me free
Light my home on fire, 
take me higher than I want to be
Baby, on my knees
Begging for the sweet release
Let me hear the choir full of liars, 
tell them I want peace

I wish I wasn't problematic

I'm burning bridges into ashes

I wish I wasn't problematic
I'm semi-automatic
I'm trying not to panic, panic
I'm burning bridges into ashes
Light them up like matches
How could you understand it, -stand it?

Why did you love me so?
Watch me as I let you go
Told you that I'm better off alone 
without you in my home
I let you in my heart
Let you back into my arms
Fool for thinking we could make it, 
faking every single part

I thought that maybe you could be
The final fucking remedy
The one to pull me out 
if I were ever stuck inside a dream
I'm looking back at times we had
The things we did and things we can't
How could you stab me in the back?
I thought you were better than that

I wish I wasn't problematic
I'm semi-automatic
I'm trying not to panic, panic
I'm burning bridges into ashes
Light them up like matches
How could you understand it, -stand it?

I wish I wasn't problematic
You could be
I'm semi-automatic
My remedy
I'm trying not to panic, panic
I'm stuck inside a dream
I'm burning bridges into ashes
The times we had
Light them up like matches
But now we can't
How could you understand it, -stand it?
You stabbed me in the back"

Forgot my bills on the stove
I left home so long ago
That my tooth's been wiggling for years
My peanut butter and your tears 
Oh why the sad face dear 
I can't control all of my fears 

It's 5am and I have to go 
The wind is tearing up my eyes 
We know we know 
Friends tell me I look so dead 
I think they're seeing through my disguise 
They know 
They know where I've been 
I get so friendly with strangers 
Ooh yeah 
The way I've been 
I get so lost in my color 
It took me some time 

That my tooth's been wiggling for years 
My peanut butter and your tears 
Oh why the sad face dear 
I can't control all of my fears 
Oo yeah

Soaked in glitter 
Never been so better
Danced away my feathers 
Look at me in my leather 
Undressed 
Soaked in glitter 
Never been so better
Danced away my feathers 
Look at me in my leather 

I hardly do as I am told 
I feel the magic in those times 
We know we know 
I hate to see your tea get cold 
From leaving the door open too wide 

Where I've been 
I get told I'm just a stranger 
Ooh yeah 
But the way I've been 
I've returned as your lost lover 
It took me some time 

And my world's been wiggling for years 
My peanut butter and your tears 
Oh why the sad face dear 
I can't control all of my fears
Oo yeah

Soaked in glitter 
Never been so better
Danced away my feathers

And everything you do
I don't mind wasting time
If I'm wasting my time with you
Girl I love you
And everything you do
The world keeps passing by
But I don't really mind do you?
Girl I knew you had my heart
Right from the very start
I felt empty every time
We were apart
Know I'm always in the studio
But I just wanted you to know
I can't wait to come home to you
I hope one day I make it big
Not for the fortune or the fame
Not for the bling
Just so I can go out and buy you everything
Buy you a house and diamond ring
'Cause baby you deserve the sun and moon
You're the reason I smile girl
Every morning when I wake
When I look into your eyes now
I don't want to look away
Girl I love you
And everything you do
I don't mind wasting time
If I'm wasting my time with you
Girl I love you
And everything you do
The world keeps passing by
But I don't really mind do you?
Baby you're my favourite muse
I stopped believing in love
But you're the proof
You make me want to write
A million songs a day
But still I would have more to say
There just isn't enough words for you
I promise I'll catch every tear
You ever cry
And hold your hand through all the years
As they go by
Just know I'll always have your back
If you forget just play this track
And know that I'll always belong to you
In the summer you're my breeze girl
In the desert you're my rain
You're my sunrise and my sunset
The best part of my day
Girl I love you
And everything you do
I don't mind wasting time
If I'm wasting my time with you
With you
Even when all the seasons change
And our lives rearrange
Like they do
The one thing that'll stay the same
Is the I way I feel for you
We can go for a drive in my car
Or just stare at the stars
And the moon
Or we could
Spend the day
Tucked away
In my bed
Just as long as I'm here next to you
Girl I love you
And everything you do
I don't mind wasting time
If I'm wasting my time with you
Girl I love you
And everything you do
The world keeps passing by
But I don't mind do you?
Do you?"

Over and over again
We hit repeat
We fight then apologize
Make up and then be alright
Yeah yeah
But if you can't relate,
Then how can we be alright?
We gotta compromise

330,Why Do I Still? (Unplugged) (feat. May Angeles),Nieman,"I'm aware of the consequence
I'm not ready yet to take that chance
Do I fold or go all in
Persuade my heart to think through it again
It sounds cliche but do you see us being
More than friends
Can't help myself but I'm fallin'
No I can't reveal
How I really feel
Cause I'm
Scared of ruining all we've built
Rather play it safe
Than find out you don't feel the same way
I don't know what I'd do if it were real
Trying my best to stop this love
Even then it's against my will
Even after all is said and done
Why do I still
Why do I still
I wish that I could somehow read your mind
I wonder if I run through yours
The way you do in mine
Can't help myself but I'm fallin'
Words aren't easy
When my eyes don't say the same
Wish I could tell you just as easy as
I say your name
Do I fold or go all in all in all in
And I can't reveal
How I really feel
Cause I'm
Scared of ruining all we've built
I'd rather play it safe
Than find out you don't feel the same way
I don't know what I'd do if that were real
Trying my best to stop this love
Even then it's against my will
Even after all is said and done
Why do I still
Why do I
I realize what's at stake but I don't know
How to show you how I really feel
Truly feel baby
Is where we go all set in stone
Is this storyline signed and sealed
Signed and sealed
Maybe
I'll keep on guessing the same question
And that's if I can go on
Without the one I want
Is this all even worth it
I think it is
But I can't reveal
How I really feel
Scared of ruining all we've built
I'd rather play it safe
Than find out you don't feel the same way
I don't know what I'd do if that were real
No I can't reveal
How I really feel
Cause I'm
Scared of ruining all we've built
I'd rather play it safe
Than find out you don't feel the same way
I don't know what I'd do if that were real

I misunderstood

Love ain't always roses
Sometimes life gets in the way
Trust me, I have noticed, baby
Gotta find that spark
And make up for lost time
Even when my mind was gone
Day was long
You'll always be mine
Maybe it's me
Or maybe it's you
All I know is that to win
It's gonna take two

We're still dating
We don't need a reason
No special occasion
And focus on us
Just because

Us
It's on us if we're gonna make it

It takes communication
You and me we gotta
Make it through the night
Gotta find our way back to the light

No special occasion

When tomorrow comes
I hope that there’s sunshine and
I hope i get paid

Pocket full of sunshine
Flowers help me find my way before the sunrise


When I wake up in the evening my mind is upset
But I say, ""F**k that,""
add up the chemicals in my brain
Walking down the boulevard, am I numb yet?
Losing grip on my feet, I can't run, run away


Pocket full of sunshine
Flowers help me find my way before the sunrise


Spending days in darkened rooms
Wish the light would come
Tired of holding onto you
I don’t need your love
Got my tools and happiness
I've been waiting for you
Save me sunshine when you're gone
I could take some more


Pocket full of sunshine
Flowers help me find my way before the sunrise
Pocket full of sunshine
Tell me that you’re on the way
And I’ll be alright

I've been fading to the background
Don't leave my room for like a week, 
don't wanna go out
But all these moments 
keep me reminding me of just how
Just how you can't have the high's 
without the letdowns
I overcomplicate
I underestimate
How easy it is to live like this
Feel better if I take my time
Just a second and I'll be alright
I know that there's a love that's gonna find me
There's something 'bout that feeling
There's something 'bout that feeling
There's something 'bout that feeling
There's something 'bout that feeling
Outside, the rain's done dancing 
with the storm clouds
But inside, there's not a dry eye 
in this whole house
And it ain't sadness 
why these tears keep falling down now
I know I'm not alone, 
I just get caught up in myself
I overcomplicate
I underestimate
I know that there's a love that's gonna find me
There's something 'bout that feeling

Rare to find someone
where I can't name a single flaw

I think it's stupid that I miss you

Baby, what's the issue
Well, we're both new to town
Though you don't ever stay in one place long
Don't think that it's your crowd
And now, I wanna be the one that proves you wrong
'Cause I thought that I knew better
And I guess that you knew best
And now I've got this feeling
I can't get out of my chest
I think it's stupid that I miss you
That I wanna kiss you
Baby, what's the issue
You don't even call
Thought we had a good time
Driving down the coastline
Why you gotta ghost
I hope it's not my fault
Said you like how I dress
And you heart every text
So, I guess I don't get where you've gone
It's stupid that I miss you
That I wanna kiss you
Baby, what's the issue
Stupid I miss you
I know you said that you would ring
But I figured it was just a bad time
Even if it's not really my thing
I think that we would make good valentines
'Cause I thought that I knew better
Now I'll never forget
That valentine's day isn't your thing either
Should have guessed

Never thought that you would
Break my heart like this bottle

Won't fade tattoo on my chest

What we used to call :
'Love' - it made us blind
and stole the colours of the night
Maybe by then we'll remember love
How long has it been?
Since a word made us feel
Since a smile made us sing
And the summer rain brings :
What we used to call love
What we used to call love
Maybe back then we knew of love

Maybe I just wanna know of love"

And I try not to ask for much 
'Cause what if I do the thing 
that makes you run for good

Turning all of my feelings off
So here is a short and simple list 
Of all that I want from you 
Can you kiss me in the morning
Hold me tight in the evening
And tell me that it'll all be okay
Will you look me in the eye
'Cause I have secrets to confide
I want you to hear what I have to say 
And buy me roses on Valentine's Day 
'Cause this is how I was taught
Be glad for a little or a lot
But I'm learning that love is the safety 
To ask for what you need 
Can you kiss me in the morning
Hold me tight in the evening
And tell me that it'll all be okay
Will you look me in the eye
'Cause I have secrets to confide
I want you to hear what I have to say 
Will you look me in the eye

I want you to wipe my tears away

I am already on my way
And I'm letting go of you
When the sun sets on our moment
I won't hold on to that feeling
You don't even notice if I'm broken
It's alright
I don't miss you I don't need you
I've accepted now I'm feeling more alive
You never string me along
Everything going wrong is
Washed up on the tide
Tonight I'm washed up on stranger tides
I hold my breath holding on tight
The waves collide stranger tides
Yeah the current feels so strong
Having me wish that I was wrong
Tonight we're washing up on stranger tides
We're overdone so I'm on the run
Wondering how far I'd get before
I'd be found had you asking all around
Oh yeah
Had a bad persona laid it on ya
Thinking you'd have me forever babe
Now I'm cool let me simmer down
To something new
When the sun sets on our moment
I won't hold on to that feeling
You don't even notice I feel hopeless
I'm in denial
I don't miss you I don't need you
I've accepted even if it took awhile
Your eyes are looking so vacant
Don't know how much longer I'll take
Tonight I'm washed up on stranger tides
I hold my breath holding on tight
The waves collide stranger tides
Yeah the current feels so strong
Having me wish that I was wrong
Tonight we're washing up on stranger tides
I'm giving in I'll let you win
The tide will bring me back again
I'm giving in so let me in for the ride
I'm giving in I'll let you win
The tide will bring me back again

You're passing the time, counting days
Numbing us down, novacane
Saw the sun turn into the moon
A thousand more times in my room
It's becoming the dullest of views
Maybe i'm building up doubt
But every thought circles around
The thought of overthinking about
Where we are
But i don't feel fully convinced
When you sweet talk
And mix resistance
I don't wanna wear us out
Where we are
Something's here but
Something's missing
Feels so close but nonexistent
I don't wanna let it go
I don't wanna let it go
Making room but slowly closing
Every door my heart has opened
I don't wanna let it go
But is there even anything to hold?
I know i could make the space
Fill it up with someone who won't wanna stay
To have another love or another pain
Repeating old mistakes
Soft and light with no commitment
Play it safe to keep a distance
Are we only friends with no hard feelings?
but we're back in the same bed
I need more than a lil sweetness
Whip cream, cherries on top of patience
Farther than my expectations
Ohh
Something's here but
Something's missing
Feels so close but nonexistent
I don't wanna let it go
I don't wanna let it go
Making room but slowly closing
Every door my heart has opened
I don't wanna let it go
But is there even anything to hold?

Do I speak?
Do I dance?
Do I sing?
Are you here?
Hearing the sound of your thoughts
run wild and free
Don't you dare to tame those voices inside
When your heart paints you with colors of life
Will you speak?
Will you dance?
Will you sing?
Rumors and biases
Are we just all chasing?
Loud words and noises
Tangled up in my head
Leaves me nothing
But these scars and bruises
Numbers and promises
How can I be defined?
So dear hold me close and see me

before others find out

Does sound like mine

It is not our battle to fight
I want love just one love
Cuz life is full grown
On blue tears and sorrow

Des milliers des insects

A forgé mon foutu caractère



On garde en mémoire que les bavures
De vieilles histoires des vieilles rancunes
Elles rendent nos joies dérisoires
Des journées obscures des âmes sans armures
Il m'a fallu être terre à terre
Pour aimer la vie sans jamais être amère

Je rêve je m'enferme
Je sais qu'au fond de moi
Des milliers de combats
S'enflamment et se terrent
Tout ce que j'ai vécu
A forgé mon foutu caractère

이번엔 내가 울것만같아

Strumming down to my memories
지직거리는 라디오에선
또 뻔한 love song
잊고있던 아픈 설레임
널 생각나게해

우리 걷던 이길위에
흘러나오던 멜로디 
흥얼거렸었지 넌 어디있니
하늘은 이렇게 맑은데
비에 젖은 내 마음을
따뜻하게도 비춰주던 너는
나에게 햇살같아
그런널 왜 난 보냈을까
Good bye

So hard to lose but easy to repeat
푹 숙인 얼굴 날 알아봤을까
I'm losing my breathe
잊고싶은 아픈 기억들
날 더 힘들게해

시간가는 줄도 모르고
나눴던 수많은 밤과 사랑노래
꿈보다 달콤했지
쉽게 포기한건아닌지
우연히널 마주친 순간
내 마음 들킬까봐 뒤돌아섰어
널 잡았다면
그런 널 왜 난 보냈을까

틀림없이 끝이 있다는 것
끝난 뒤엔 지겨울 만큼
오랫동안 쉴 수 있다는 것

i tried everything
turns out we can't compete
oh reality is never quite as good as the dream
no i won't dance anymore
no i won't put on a show
and you can blame it on me
i don't care what they think
no i won't let you control
no i won't be what you want
and you can blame it on me
i don't care what you think
from the moment i saw you
i had never felt i could choose
it was always gonna be you
even when they told me not to
you were all i wanted
but now you're gone and
what good's a promise
if you're never really honest
no i won't dance anymore
no i won't put on a show
and you can blame it on me
i don't care what they think
no i won't let you control
no i won't be what you want
and you can blame it on me
i don't care what you think
by the way, piece by piece
i found out my hero's me
happiness doesn't mean
smilin' when it's your scene
you made sure to keep me small 
enough to keep in between
should i stay, should i leave
could i ever compete
with a bar you set so high 
that you could never even reach
no i won't dance anymore
no i won't put on a show
and you can blame it on me
i don't care what they think
no i won't let you control

Another thing I ruined I used to do for fun
Another piece of plastic I could just throw away
Another conversation with nothing good to say
I thought it so I said it took it 'cause I can
Another day pretendin' I'm older than I am
Another perfect moment
That doesn't feel like mine
Another thing I forced to be a sign
Well sometimes I feel like
I don't wanna be where I am
Gettin' drunk at a club
With my fair weather friends
Push away all the people who know me the best
But it's me who's been makin' the bed
I'm so tired of bein' the girl that I am
Every good thing has
Turned into somethin' I dread
And I'm playin' the victim so well in my head
But it's me who's been makin' the bed
Me who's been makin' the bed
Pull the sheets over my head yeah
Makin' the bed
And every night
I wake up from this one recurrin' dream
Where I'm drivin' through the city
And the brakes go out on me
I can't stop at the red light
Can't swerve off the road
I read somewhere it's 'cause my life
Feels so out of control
And I tell someone
I love them just as a distraction
They tell me that they love me like
I'm some tourist attraction
They're changin' my machinery
And I just let it happen
I got the things I wanted
It's just not what I imagined
Well sometimes
I feel like I don't wanna be where I am
Gettin' drunk at a club
With my fair weather friends
Push away all the people who know me the best
But it's me who's been makin' the bed
I'm so tired of bein' the girl that I am

that I first met you

Before you were mine didn't know 
where this road was going
And I was caught up thinking
I'll never be anyone that would need 
what you've given me
Now I don't ever wanna live 
another second without you
Though it's the beginning 
I look forward to what could
Be the rest of your life getting to know

언제부턴가 점점 내 하루에 스며든 너
아침을 깨우는 네 생각에 
어느샌가 거리엔 어둠이 젖어 들고

취기를 빌려 오늘 너에게 고백할거야
하루하루 네가 좋다고
괜히 어색할까 혼자 애만 태우다
끝끝내 망설여왔던 순간

알잖아 나 무뚝뚝하고 말도 없는걸
서툰 표현이 쑥스러워서 괜히 
쓰다 지울 문자만 바라보다
멋쩍은 쓴웃음만

언제부턴가 가끔 너와 마주칠 때마다
한참을 머뭇거린 어설픈 손 인사만
오늘 밤도 후회로 잦아들고

취기를 빌려 오늘 너에게 고백할 거야
하루하루 보고 싶다고
괜히 어색할까 혼자 애만 태우다
수없이 연습해왔던 그 말

알잖아 나 무뚝뚝하고 말도 없는걸
서툰 표현이 쑥스러워서 괜히 
쓰다 지울 문자만 바라보다
멋쩍은 쓴웃음만

첫눈을 빌려 오늘은 꼭 고백할거야
작은 너를 품에 안고서 눈을 마주하고
너무 사랑한다고 함께 하고 싶다고"

바람이 불어들 때
가슴 아팠던 날들 기억을 타고 와 
스르르 미소가 되지

도로를 타는 불빛들 그 사이에서 
너와 듣던 노래들
지금 어디에서 뭘 하고 있을까 
우린 life goes on

흔하다고 해도 있는 그대로를 
전부 믿고 싶던 그때의 나를
후회한다 해도 이젠 잊어야 해

어깨가 닿도록 걷는 저 많은 사람들
모두 어디로 향해 가고 있을까 
멈춘 계절은 언제쯤 널 데려올까

그리운 너의 목소리 들려올 때면 
차오르는 한숨이
그땐 왜 그랬을까 참 나약했던 내 모습 
자꾸 그려져

변하는 게 너무나도 겁이 나서 
너를 도망쳐 왔어

여기까지 와 이제 좀 알 것 같은데 
네가 없는걸

눈물을 배우고 아픔을 알고서 
미소 짓는 법도 알게 됐지
너도 그랬을까 한참을 앓고서 
내게만 보여준 미소였을까 
돌아갈 수 없게 멀어진 yesterday

바쁜 하루하루에 널 잊었다가도 
그런 매일매일에 순간 웃어봐도
잠깐 밀려온 기억은 한순간도 날 
그대로 두질 않아

시간이 흐르면 내게 다 하지 못했던 
그 한마디도 너를 향하던 마음도 
잊혀 질 줄만 알았지 계절이 가면 

아무도 만질 수 없는 기억의 바람 
변해가는 거리에 다시 불어오면

Who'll never hold me in their hearts
And then I will lie under the spell of
Their resounding glory and raving stories
Of how they need to stay apart
Time will ease the strain to wander
And time will heal my wretched love
And I will leave the way to wonder
Why you're inside me

I'lll seek for all the ones
Who'll try to deal with all my faults
And my need of love suddenly rears
Its head and drowns my spirit
Forces my hand
And sends me out into the cold

 Got close to some epiphany
 I'll convince a friend to join deep ends
 Have your toes touch the lack of cement

 Gather to one corner of the woods
 Echo chambers inside a neighborhood
 And centerfold, humility shown
 You're not as good as what your mama's sewn

 Aren't you glad that you reside
 In a hell and in disguise?
 Nobody yet everything
 A pool to shed your memory

 Could you say you even tried?
 You haven't called your family twice
 I can hope tonight goes differently
 But I show up to the party just to leave

 Between the gaps, keep it under wraps
 How I got to some epiphany
 I'll convince myself when it turns to twelve
 The photos keep the sentiment

 Gather to one corner of the woods
 Echo chambers inside a neighborhood
 And centerfold, humility shown
 You're not as good as what your mama's sewn

 Aren't you glad that you reside
 In a hell and in disguise?
 Nobody yet everything
 A pool to shed your memory

 Could you say you even tried?
 You haven't called your family twice
 I can hope tonight goes differently
 But I show up to the party just to leave

 Pulling back I tried to find
 The point of wasting precious time

So I can forget everything

And we're on a train zigzagging 'cross the countryside
On our way home from a party
That turned insane

He dozes off on my shoulder
Wakes up suddenly, apologizes
Looks the other way

So tell me how
Tell me how I can tell him I love him
So tell me how

The neighbor came a-knocking
Said she'd call the cops
He said, ""I'll turn down the stereo""
Pretended to adjust the volume knob

He's my best friend
And we can talk about anything
As long it's about nothing
As long as it don't cut deeper than the skin

Tell me how
Tell me how I can tell him I love him
So tell me how
Tell me how I can tell him I love him, so
Tell me how

I mean I guess he knows
Just like I know when he says something funny and I laugh from my belly
Or when Sandra left him and I held him when he cried
For a moment he left his guard down and so did I

But it's so deep within me, the way a man should be
Passed on through generations of men before me
A line drawn in the sand to keep us apart
A rusty, old padlock hanging on our hearts

So tell me how

We part ways at the station
He's got his bike and he rides into the gap
'Tween day and night
Before he's gone he shouts, ""Later, dude""
I think, ""Yeah
I love you too"""

Me and my niggas be rollin'
Schemin' on u and your homies
The very first day of summer
All chromed out in a Hummer, babe
Hit the park and parlay
Hopin' that u walk this way
Do u and your girls wanna ride
Play all day and puff on the la

Ooh, say what, say what, say what
Ooh, girl u know what's up
Ooh, say what, say what, say what
Ooh, girl u know what's up

I'm diggin' u and I'm feelin' u
U know what's up
Said i'm diggin' u and I'm wantin' u
So tell me what's up

Peep her thighs and I'm zonin'
Right around two in the mornin'
Lookin' fly with a sundress on
Think I feel a bone comin on
Girl u got it wide open
Want all day and in hopin'
Baby don't front
Back seat Jeep, u know what I want

Ooh, say what, say what, say what
Ooh, girl u know what's up
Ooh, say what, say what, say what
Ooh, girl u know what's up

So baby tell me what's up
Can we ascend to higher heights
And when the path gets rough
We can give in to brighter nights
Breathe with peace, expand by leaps
Sow to reap our souls to keep
The passions deep and filled with heat
Living this life on the hustle
I barely get enough time
U know me for the Platinum
How I stack them and shine
U see a lot of contenders
They try to end up in my world
A reputation known as the untouchable girl
I'm movin' on and now I'm tryin'
To make a change in my ways
Be the best that I can be
To last me all of my days
Now we can blaze pathways
Or just take our time
Better hollar if you hear me
Cuz Left-Eye gonna shine
My eyes don't lie see how
They glisten when you pass me by
U and I don't need permission to be unified
Surely I done seen and heard of many places
Then I traveled around the world, seen many faces
don't let another one get near me if you wanna be true
And show me that nobody else can do it better than you
So if you serious, I'm curious to see what you got
My love is furious, cuz I believe in blowin' up spots

Ooh, say what, say what, say what
Ooh, girl u know what's up
Ooh, say what, say what, say what
Ooh, girl u know what's up"
606,Calm Down Remix (Feat. Frankie Stew and Harvey Gunn),Barney Artist,"You said that you don’t know man still 
way that you rolled in like a gold wheel 
Flames are evolving let me hold still
Holding your waist whilst you notice the skills
Girl wanna mess with A G
G check anybody wanna mess with the team 
Team bless

Oh 
Let me calm down 
Buss a skank let me get your guard down 
Felt the bassline in the bar now 
Arch your back baby put your glass down 
Like Oh
Look Let me calm down 
Buss a skank let me get your guard down 
Feel the bassline in the bar now 
Arch your back let me put your glass down

Let me calm down
Never passing 
Then I pass out
When I’m half in 
Then I’m half out
Wanna start things 
Let me start now 
It’s a lot 
Sometimes things don’t go how you want 
I never been unfaithful don’t watch
I could’ve been unfaithful bare times but i can’t do things like that not once 
Sometimes things don’t go how you plan 
I hold on tight with both my hands 
I’m wondering if you know when I’m at
These things don’t speak to nobody and it’s a real feeling
I can still feel it 
Kicked off been grief for the whole evening 
Said I hate you shit but I don’t mean it 
If you don’t come back then it’s no secret 
Nah if you don’t come back then it’s fair enough 
Feels weird feels like I’m scared to love 
And please don’t cry stop tearing up
Been down more time but I’m here for us

Oh 
Let me calm down 
Buss a skank let me get your guard down 
Felt the bassline in the bar now 
Arch your back baby put your glass down 
Like Oh
Look Let me calm down 
Buss a skank let me get your guard down 
Feel the bassline in the bar now 
Arch your back let me put your glass down

Backing it calm
Gathering hearts
Put me in your pocket without a secondary glance
Arguing in public I feel like nothing would last 
Pressing all my buttons I feeling gameboy advanced
I wrote a song about you 
When to the stew for a gun I feel like Frankie and Harv
Never been alarmed 
Everytime I bar
But I feel like a full/fool
When I’m losing my half
half way half way
Text my Ex is it my day 
Ahh wait 
Ahhh babe 
Phone in my hand are you gonna call me 
Shit
I ain’t gonna front for you babe
Dumping my stuff down the drain
Fumbling love in my brain
Am I dumb am I sane?  
But I feel like I’m numb to the pain?
What you saying

Oh 
Let me calm down 
Buss a skank let me get your guard down 
Felt the bassline in the bar now 
Arch your back baby put your glass down 
Like Oh
Look Let me calm down 
Buss a skank let me get your guard down 
Feel the bassline in the bar now 
Arch your back let me put your glass down
Let me calm down

Felt the bassline in the bar now

611,Give Up On Me,Skizzy Mars(스키지 마스),"Damn, why you hesitant and noncommittal
I had my eyes on you since I was little
Yeah, I use to shoot hoops and kill time
You had a man I played second fiddle
And I wish that you would call back
And I wish that I could fall back
And I wish that I can hear you
New York City in the rear view
I grew up poor, getting rich now
A couple thou on my wrist now
Down south kids help me get down
Never really went through the struggle, like she missed out
Roll a joint better than me I'm like this chick wild
Went from sign my shoe, Y-3s, they say I switched out
Do you believe in second chances and first dances
And romantic, advancements?

Well damn you look good, I know you're right
I don't wanna sleep alone tonight
I don't wanna drop you off at home tonight
Can I come in
Baby you and I just coincide
Baby you and I are so alike
I don't wanna drop you off at home tonight
Can I come in
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me

Girl why you acting so distant
Don't tell me, mind your business
Across the club, use to blow kisses
Couple years, things get so different
I know you like that
Send you dirty texts did I type that
S Mars on the breast did I write that
New to the city, you the type that
Never waits in lines, never takes your time
Let's get food and drugs, cannot get enough
All ends 72 then you call my plug
Really take a cig, but you acting tuff
Never planned on falling in love or doing these drugs
And making it up as I go
I'm breaking your heart, don't know where to start
But there's one thing that I know

Well damn you look good, I know you're right
I don't wanna sleep alone tonight
I don't wanna drop you off at home tonight
Can I come in
Baby you and I just coincide
Baby you and I are so alike
I don't wanna drop you off at home tonight
Can I come in
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me

Don't give up on me
Don't leave me lonely
Girl you're my one and only

Don't give up on me
Don't leave me lonely
Girl you're my one and only

Well damn you look good, I know you're right
I don't wanna sleep alone tonight
I don't wanna drop you off at home tonight
Can I come in
Baby you and I just coincide
Baby you and I are so alike
I don't wanna drop you off at home tonight
Can I come in
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me"

눈빛에 베일 듯 우린 날카로워
마침표를 찍고 난 조금 더 멀리 가려 해
만남은 쉽고 이별은 참 어려워
아직도 기억나 차 안의 공기가
처음 들었을 때 마음이 짜릿했던 뭔가가
6살이었지만 알았었지 뭔가 다르단 건
그렇게 쉽게 만나게 되는 거야 꿈이란 건
시간이 흘러서 이제 음악은 내 놀이가 됐고
듣고 따라만 부르기엔 내게는 뭔가 부족했어
그래서 실행에 옮겼지
방에서 혼자 꿈만 꾸던 모습
가사를 쓰고 부를 때 사실 내가 생각했던 건
돌아가야 할까 나아가야 할까
환호와 박수 소리를 들을 때
떠나야 할 것 같지 왜
지금 떠나서 아름다운 기억으로만 간직해
다들 꿈이란 건 이루지 못한 채 꾸고만 사는데
It's Ok 괜찮아 난 맛이라도 봤잖아
다시 현실로 돌아가 그래 취직하고 잘 살아
잘 잊혀지고 있잖아

눈빛에 베일 듯 우린 날카로워
마침표를 찍고 난 조금 더 멀리 가려 해
만남은 쉽고 이별은 참 어려워
어렵게 시간이 지나고
다시금 만난 그 꿈은 꽤 반짝였지
이제는 영원할 것만 같았던
그 시간은 잠깐이었지
그렇게 어렵게 놓아줬었는데
쉽게 다시 왔다 멀어지는 건
내 의지완 달라 멀어지는 걸
인정하기는 죽기보다 싫어
섭섭할 뿐이지 모자란 내 자신한테
거짓말했었던 날들이 반복돼 사실 알고 있던
것들인데도 난 모른 척
문제가 없는 척 언제나 척뿐이었지
잘 돼가는 거 하나도 없는데
내 자존심 챙기는 것뿐이었지
어쩌면 알고 있었지 모든 걸
아니 알고 있었어 전부터
왜 모르겠어 I ain't dumb
이별은 어렵지만 피할 수 없는 거 같아
준비는 예전부터 했는지도 몰라
이제는 생긴 거 같아 마침표를 찍을 용기가
끝나도 괜찮아 정말 할 수 있는 건 다 해봤어
다음 페이지에 끝나도 좋아
그러나 거기에 너가 있다면
이 얘기의 끝을 미룰 거야
그게 내가 원하던 결말
아직도 어려워 이미 해봤던 이별이라도
만남은 쉽고 이별은 어려워
눈빛에 베일 듯 우린 날카로워
마침표를 찍고 난 조금 더 멀리 가려 해
만남은 쉽고 이별은 참 어려워

이 자리에 서 있을게요

근데 왜 danger

느껴보지 못한 가난이야 개털처럼
대체 나 왜 이래
돌려 play back
내일의 나를 기대했던 때로
그래 더 세게
몰아붙여 그때의 마음
그때의 밤

나는 like zebra
흑과 백 색깔 어디로 물들어도
안 이상했던 날 잡아준 mama's 식탁

Sitting in the sun on the grass, yeah yeah

To breathe it all in
Drank a little red wine

We're getting closer
But we're trying to be friends
If we start it might never end
So we keep tiptoeing
When we met I wasn't interested
I did half a glance
Didn't want to chance it
Now I lie awake and I think about you
Because there's a moral to this story
But I don't know it
Always listen to myself
But not this time I guess
Keep on running from it
But I want it
I do
How you gonna make me do
This dance again
We're getting closer
But we're trying to be friends
If we start it might never end
So we keep tiptoeing
I drag my heels 'cause I just can't walk away
Fantasising if you want to you could stay
And be my baby but our hearts might break
So we keep tiptoeing
It's forbidden but I still want you
I wanna taste the fruit
But I just can't chance it
So much at risk and I'm scared to lose
And there's a moral to the story
But I've lost my head
There's a million different secrets
We should leave unsaid
Should be running from it
But I want it
I do
How you gonna make me do this dance again?
We're getting closer
But we're trying to be friends
If we start it might never end

And now I want you back 
When it's hits midnight Every time 

Tearing me up
Tearing me down
You make the man in me spin right around 
My days are up without a doubt 
So baby come to me 
Save me 


Don't go walk out that front door
Stay with me
Don't fold, want you in my lap like some faded jeans
But this ain't another washed up love
Though we're going in circles, circles, circles

And now I want you back
When it's hits midnight Every time

I don't go to crowded bars or afterparties
Searchin' for a missin' piece
I love my friends I like my job
I like all the shit I got goin' on
But you're so smooth and you so cute
Guess I could make some room
In the front seat on the right side of my car
Midnight in the middle of my arms
Somewhere in the corner of my heart
There's a little space for you
Fresh sheets on the edge of my king size
Top drawer for your things if you feel like
I'm sayin' if you wanna stick around in my life
There's a little space for you
Didn't ever really get it
Why they make tables for two?
But sippin' on this Cabernet 
I gotta say it's hittin' different next to you
I like your jokes I like your face
I love every way that you say my name
You're so cute and you're so smooth
Think I could get used to you
In the front seat on the right side of my car
Midnight in the middle of my arms
Somewhere in the corner of my heart

Fresh sheets on the edge of my king size
Top drawer for your things if you feel like
I'm sayin' if you wanna stick around in my life

Just never thought you were cool, hey
What can I do?
When did you get so cute, babe
Operating so smoothly
It's like you're looking right through me
Out of the blue
I just came to dance with myself
Baby, I don't need nobody else
But what's your sign, though?
Do you have a plan, I can't tell
All you gotta do is take my hand
And I will follow you
Down the road
To somewhere under the bridge
Where you'll sing me a song
I never knew you were someone to love
Staring at your lips
While you're singing a song out of the blue
Now you're someone I could love
Someone I could love
Now you're standing here and I won't lie
You're getting close and I don't mind
Did we just cross at the wrong time?
When we were young
No I wasn't ready
I had my head in a cloud when you met me
Might make it up to you now
If you let me, baby
I just came to dance with myself
Baby, I don't need nobody else
But what's your sign, though?
Do you have a plan, I can't tell
All you gotta do is take my hand

Every stranger I meet
I see your face
And I tried to move on but I'm tangled
in memories of you
I want to go out tonight
Get out of my head tonight
But I know it won't do
Cuz there ain't nobody fine enough
No there ain't no drink that's strong enough
No there ain't nobody high that's high enough
To make me forget about you
Forget about you
I still make two cups of coffee
One for you
One for me
Scrolling through every memory
But I don't know how long these pictures will do
I want to go out tonight
Get out of my head tonight
But I know it won't do
Cuz there ain't nobody fine enough
No there ain't no drink that's strong enough
No there ain't nobody high that's high enough

Forget about you
Can't forget about you
Can't forget about you

어두운 거리속으로
보이지 않는 이곳을 헤매고 있을
날 찾아줘
익숙했던 목소리
잠시 머뭇거리다가 흐려져
잊고있던 내 모습이 보여
무거웠던 말들이 나를 또 덮친다

I would stay the whole night with my red eyes

Still I would try so hard to find out 
the meaning of your text

Wish it could be easy
Just like when we were young
Simply i'd go just to look up
dictionary to find a meaning
Love is never easy
You remind me of it
Everyday and every night
Telling me you don't mean that

Mean
Why you be so mean
Saying that you think of me
Then in the morning
Saying it ain't mean a thing
Why you be so mean
you know how much you mean to me
To me
Guess you don't know the meaning of love

I could try so hard to ignore you
not picking up your call
Wish I could tell you hundred reasons
To get you off my mind
Well my friends have told me
just forget it
He's no good for you
I said I would but in a minute
I'm calling you again

Wish it could be easy
Just like when we were young
Simply i'd go just to look up
dictionary to find a meaning

Everyday and every night
Telling me you don't mean that

Wake your love up
Wake your love love

Can you just be reckless 
for once for me for you
I would show you the bottom of me
covering all of your bruises
Come over me

You couldn’t take the blame
Couldn’t you?

Go back and look at yourself in the mirror

너 하나고 이제는 됐어 딱히

Never knowing why
Everything you say
Oh my heart it breaks
I'm just a toy without a name of mine
No one to care for
No one passing by
And I can't deny
All those petty lies
And in my disguise
I'm just an ordinary state of mind
Can't seem to know if I am dead, alive
Every time I try
Cannot make it right"

내 두 눈은 너로 물들었고
붉게 물든 하늘을 보며
너에게 말할게

저 달을 닮았던 너의 모습이 보여서
자주 갔던 밤하늘은 다 사라져가고
아무 의미 없는 추억만 그리다가

이젠 너 없이도 나름 Better now
힘들었던 기억마저도 새로워
You said i love you 그게 전부다 lie
Don't tryna everything
다 지났어 이제 난 Sober
가끔씩 떠올리곤 해 너와 나
이전에 계속 찍어놨던 Drama
넌 어디서 뭘 하느라
그렇게 날 두고 가버린 거야
안갯속에 널 가린 채 잊혀진
너의 뒷모습이 달에 비춰 보일 때
Let's pray, replay
I just want 그저 잘 지내고 있길 just pray
아마 더 나은 Better one
이제는 볼 수 없는 너의 그때로 더
내가 없는 하루에
너의 밤은 어때

Sweet lullaby
Oh it's so hypnotizin'
Sweet talk to me babe
It's magical
I wanna hear you sing it every night
I can't help this feelin'
Like I know your secrets
Hope it lasts forever I want it I want it
Whisperin' so gently
Eyelids gettin' heavy
Make it last forever I want it I want it
You make me ay ay ay
You got me driftin' in and out of this slumber
You make me ay ay ay
I know for sure I never wanna wake up
Lovin' the touch of your fingers
In my hair it still lingers
Tell me is it truth or fiction baby
Still can't believe you and me are
Makin' music each day
Anythin' from your lips got me
Thinkin' it's all okay
I don't need fortune or the fame
As long as I'm with you
Oh when you say my name
It sounds like a song
And I'd listen all day long
Oh I don't understand it
But I can't turn it off
Baby don't ever stop
Sweet talk to me babe
It's magical
Sweet lullaby
Oh it's so hypnotizin'
Sweet talk to me babe
It's magical
I wanna hear you sing it every night
I can't help this feelin'
Like I know your secrets
Hope it lasts forever I want it I want it
Whisperin' so gently
Eyelids gettin' heavy
Make it last forever I want it I want it
If I'm dreaming don't ever wake me up
I wanna hear your melody
The only thing I could need
'Cause if I had to live without you
I'd be lost
And in this moment I want more
Sweet talk to me babe
It's magical
Sweet lullaby
Oh it's so hypnotizin'
Sweet talk to me babe
It's magical
I wanna hear you sing it every night
Sweet talk to me babe
It's magical"

Talking about nothing
You would ever say to my face
You think your words are Gospel
But they're only trouble
I ain't got the time to waste

You need to get a life
Cause life's too short
You must be bored out your mind
You should really take that nonsense
somewhere else
Cause you've got to realize

I'm doing me regardless
And I don't care
what you say about it
And it don't matter
if you like it or not
I'm having all this fun so
Why would I ever stop

Doing me regardless
No I don't care
what you say about it
And Imma do it any way
that I want
I'm having all this fun so
Why would I ever stop

Some people are so mean
All behind a phone screen
When we're tryna live our lives
Why you gotta be so vicious
Be about your business
'stead of getting up in mine

You need to get a life
Cause life's too short
You must be bored out your mind
You should really take that nonsense

Cause you've got to realize

They might grow one day but
Either way

I'm losing my composure
Can't nobody do me better
Time and time again
I told myself I need to let go
Then I fall right back into your arms

Oh my god She showed me all the stars
Nothing can pull me away
From your embrace
I'm not going anywhere
Here we go again
I hear the sound of pain
Flowing slowly through my veins"

What about us?

I think this is gonna be
a Christmas worth remembering
the best you’ll ever see

Let’s go! Come on, girls!

I’m looking out through the window
footsteps somewhere in the snow
It is still as fun
just like when I was young
memories from years ago

This man he won’t ever fail me
I know he’s making his round
Reindeers are rushing their 
way through the night
Santa he won’t let me down

And last night I had trouble sleeping
There’s so much going on in my head
hearing the sounds through the chimney top 
stayed quiet in my bed

I always got expectations
I’m hearing sleigh bells right now
They’re under that tree got a present for me
Santa he won’t let me down

Let’s hear it, Santa! Here we go! Come on!

This man he won’t ever fail me
I know he’s making his round
Reindeers are rushing their 
way through the night

And last night I had trouble sleeping
There’s so much going on in my head
hearing the sounds through the chimney top 
stayed quiet in my bed

I always got expectations
I’m hearing sleigh bells right now
I can't believe what I see, no, no
They’re under that tree got a present for me

Stuck at the start, we're
Watching them go back
Waiting for our right
Wondering if we're gonna be alright

Waving at cars
Wishing they were ours
Why are we waving at cars? Just
Watching them pass, is
That who we are?

Talking about all the fears we share
Or we could just go get those windows open
And you and I could finally go somewhere

I'm painting a picture and I want you in it

D**n I hate this town  uh yeah
And 26 don’t treat me well all the time
I really miss some of the things left behind
Back home
Kind of feel alone

I Look Around 
Wonder where I’m at 
Guess I’m in the 

Hall of Fame 
Chilling next to Kurt Cobain 
Everybody knows my name 
they sing my song
Nothing ever could go wrong 
In the Hall of Fame 
24K golden frame 
Even If the the sky falls down it starts to rain 
It's always sunny in the Hall of Fame 

And my 11 year old self would be proud 
If he could see himself
 in front of the crowd right now
Hear’em scream out loud
And I’d do it again in a heartbeat 
Though I know what it does to my head
Maybe I should slow down 
But time keeps keeps running ahead  
Ahead in the

Hall of Fame 
Chilling next to Kurt Cobain 
Everybody knows my name
 they sing my song
Nothing ever could go wrong 
In the Hall of Fame 
24K golden frame 
Even If the the sky falls down
it starts to rain 
It's always sunny in the Hall of Fame 

I look around wonder where I’m at 
Last few years flew by so fast
Don’t remember yesterday 
I guess this really is

Hall of Fame 
Chilling next to Kurt Cobain 
Everybody knows my name
they sing my song
Nothing ever could go wrong 
In the Hall of Fame 
24K golden frame 
Even if the the sky falls down
it starts to rain 
It's always sunny in the Hall of Fame 
It’s always sunny
It’s always sunny
In the morning and the afternoon
It's always sunny in the Hall of Fame"

And out of reach from me

Say you were made to be mine
Nothing could keep us apart
You'd be the one I was meant to find

You think it's easy
You think I don't want to run to you
But there are mountains
And there are doors that we can't walk through
I know you wondering why
Because we're able to be
Just you and me within these walls
But when we go outside
You're going to wake up and see that
It was hopeless after all
No one can rewrite the stars
How can we say you'll be mine
Everything keeps us apart
And I'm not the one you were meant to find
It's not up to you
It's not up to me
When everyone tells us what we can be
How can we rewrite the stars?
Say that the world can be ours
Tonight
All I want is to fly with you
All I want is to fall with you
So just give me all of you
It feels impossible
It's not impossible
Is it impossible?
Say that it's possible
How do we rewrite the stars?
Say you were meant to be mine
Nothing can keep us apart
Cause you are the one I was meant to find
It's up to you
And it's up to me
No one can say what we get to be
Why don't we rewrite the stars?
Changing the world to be ours

I'd rather be famous instead

She put her foot to the pedal
It'll take a whole lot for me to settle

762,Strawberries & Cigarettes,Troye Sivan(트로이 시반)CONNECT 아티스트,"Remember when we first met?
You said light my cigarette
So I lied to my mom and dad
And jumped the fence and I ran
But we couldn't go very far
'Cause you locked your keys in your car
So you sat and stared at my lips
And I could already feel your kiss
Long nights daydreams
Sugar and smoke rings I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes
Always taste like you
Headlights on me
Racing to sixty I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes
Always taste like
Blue eyes black jeans
Lighters and candy I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes
Always taste like you
Remember when you taught me fate
Said it all be worth the wait
Like that night in the back of the cab
When your fingers walked in my hand
Next day nothing on my phone
But I can still smell you on my clothes
Always hoping things would change
But we went right back to your games
Long nights daydreams
Sugar and smoke rings I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes
Always taste like you
Headlights on me
Racing to sixty I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes
Always taste like
Blue eyes black jeans
Lighters and candy I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes
Always taste like you
And even if I run away
And give my heart a holiday
Still strawberries and cigarettes
Always taste like you
You always leave me wanting more
I can't shake my hunger for
Strawberries and cigarettes
Always taste like you
Yeah they always taste like you
You
Long nights daydreams
With that sugar and smoke rings
Always taste like you
Headlights on me
(And even if I run away)
Racing to sixty I've been a fool
(And give my heart a holiday)
Still strawberries and cigarettes
Always taste like
Blue eyes black jeans
(You always leave me wanting more)
Lighters and candy I've been a fool
(I can't shake my hunger for)
Strawberries and cigarettes
Always taste like you"

And I know, and I know, and I know
That you got everything

I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go

if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
I don't deserve it
I know I don't deserve it
But stay with me a minute
I'll swear I'll make it worth it
Can't you forgive me
At least just temporarily
I know that this is my fault
I should have been more careful (come on)

What would you do?
Let's just say the world ended a week from now
What would you do?
What would you do?
Only 7 days that we're counting down
Do you know who
You'd pull up close to you?
Why not tell somebody you love them
Before it's too late?
Why not tell somebody you love them
Cause it cannot wait?
Just tell somebody you love them
Before it's too late
Cause you're out running of time
Don't wait another day
Tell them that they are all you think about
Tell them that life's no good without
And with nothing left to lose
Nothing left to prove
Are you gonna tell the truth?
What would you do?
They say a smile can really brighten your night
We're stuck on this rock together rocking for life
This music jamming I'm just here for the vibe
I'm gonna tell someone I love them tonight
Why not tell somebody you love them
Before it's too late?
Why not tell somebody you love them
Cause it cannot wait?
Just tell somebody you love them
Before it's too late
Cause you're out running of time
Don't wait another day
Look your lover in the eyes and tell her tell her
I'll be with you by your side forever forever
Tell them that they are all you think about
Tell them that life's no good without
And with nothing left to lose

Are you gonna tell the truth?

This cycle of another song, a different day
It feels so fake, copy and paste
A formulaic version of the things I say


We need a hit by Monday, Monday

Gonna write a hit about
Bacardi, parties, bars, cars
If you wanna make money, money
If you wanna be a star, star

I think I sold out when the sales went up
Society sucks, I wanna refund
When you get what you want,
but it's never enough

Hang on, I thought I was winning, winning
I made a fool of myself
Society sucks, I think I messed up
I think I sold out on the day
I signed up for society


Ironically, I wanna be a piece of everything
I hate on TMZ
I need a space to rearrange
this messy room I'm living in inside my brain

Society sucks, I think I messed up
I think I sold out on the day

My head or my heart, the cash or the art
I stop to restart, I put up a guard
The glaze in your stare,
the pressure in the air
You made me feel dumb, I wasn't aware
My chords are too jazz
My lyrics are too sad
My thoughts are too dark
Well shit, that's too bad
The game knocked me out
I guess I'll check out
I guess I'll check out
I guess I'll check out

S-s-society sucks, I think I messed up
I think I sold out when the sales went up
Society sucks, I wanna refund

You played cool you played cool huh
You asked me what I could do in return

Where the sunshine always shines
There's a ring on your hand and I'm still in the band
And I hold you every night
But I lied, I lied
I wasted all your time
Made a promise that I could never keep
But I swear to God I tried
Ooh
Ooh
With my feet on the ground and my head in the clouds
I hope I find my way
Yeah, my heart's still yours, but my dream is the world
So for now I just can't stay
But I'll try, I'll try
I won't sleep a single night
So when I see this through, I'll come back for you
I'll come back for you
Ooh
Ooh
When my limbs grow old and my heart goes cold
And they lay me down to rest
I won't toss or turn, I won't let it burn
'Cause I'll know I tried my best
But I pray, I pray
You'll come back to me one day
Gave up everything for my hopes and dreams
Now I wish I would've stayed"
769,The Day That I Met You,Matilda Mann,"They telephoned me just to say
That nobody had the time for yesterday
And all at once, I felt so small
Started feeling like nobody cared at all

But then you called, only to say
You'll never love somebody else this way
And though I'm still battered and bruised
I forgave the world the day that I met you

Mm-mm, mm-mm

The people talk, it's background noise
I don't wanna hear nobody else's voice
There's something sweet about your scent
It's like lavender came and never left

But then you called, only to say
You'll never love somebody else this way
And though I'm still battered and bruised
I forgave the world the day that I met you

Mm-mm, mm-mm
Nothing ever seemed to go right
All my days they just fell into nights
Until I got a little bit of you in my life
And then suddenly everything's bright

I know there's a million different ways I could say
How you're always the part of my day
And when you feel the need to forget the world
You can call anytime you want
Call anytime you want
Mm-mmmm"
770,The Show Must Go On,Bruno Major(브루노 메이저)CONNECT 아티스트,"The credits roll you got the girl
The bad guy was defeated
As 'Pet Sounds' plays
You drive into the sunset
The crowd applauds you take a bow
It happened like you dreamed it
You got everything you have ever wanted
Cut the scene it's 4:15
You're staring at the ceilin'
It all feels out of your control
You push it down so no one knows
If you're always puttin' on a show
You'll lose yourself before you know
As easy lovers come and easy go
So you wear the mask you dry your eyes
You keep it all locked up inside
Pawn your broken heart and sell your soul
And you tell yourself you must be strong
'Cause the show must go on
The endless race to validation tell yourself
You need it
The ego's always hungry so you feed it
Keep alive the child's mind
You nurture and believe him
Your heart will tell the truth if you receive it
It recently occurred to me
Time on earth is fleetin'
And Since none of us are in control
We outta learn to let it go
If you're always puttin' on a show
You'll lose yourself before you know
As easy lovers come and easy go
So you wear the mask you dry your eyes
You keep it all locked up inside
Pawn your broken heart and sell your soul
And you tell yourself you must be strong

771,All Over Again,Sarah Kang,"What if I'd never met you
I wonder what I'd be up to
Where would I be and with what kind of view
What if there are other me's
Somewhere out in the galaxy
I let myself daydream
'Cause maybe there's some other universe
I'd put it all in reverse
If only I could I would turn back the clock
To before I ever knew you and then
I'd still end up at that same old restaurant
And fall for you all over again
All over again
You and I were magnetized
Connected by the great divine
Tiny electrons always intertwined
And if I had a hundred million lives
With infinitely different storylines
It would be you every time
If only I could I would turn back the clock
To before I ever knew you and then
I'd still end up at that same old restaurant
And fall for you all over again
All over again and again and again
And I've fallen again
Maybe there's some other universe
I'd still go after you first
If only I could I would turn back the clock
To before I was yours and then
I'd (you'd) put on that same white dress
and walk to you (me)
To say yes all over again
I'd fall for you all over again"

We're feeling comfortable, what can I say?
In love and it shows
I feel like I fall again every day

I won't ever forget
The day that we met
The moment that you said hello
I was caught by surprise
That look in your eyes
And you said we should see where this goes
In a room full of people
It still felt like we were alone
It was just you and I
That one summer night
When you ask me when did you know
The moment that you said hello
I think the both of us would know by now
That this was always gonna work somehow
And even after all this time
I will always want you around

Just admit you never really did enough
That you're not good at love
Didn't love her enough hm

I never felt all these feelings

The oceans to rise
But I lay here broken
Too heavy to float
I'm an emotionless wreck

Make molehills of mountains
There's gold in this ground
But I ain't found it yet
So I leave before you go

Don't compare
Take the river to the sea
Drown myself so I don't sink
Find my peace there underneath
The hurricane
Break a promise so I can leave
Burn a forest so I can sleep
Lay my headstone
Let the grass grow over me
There's nothing to fill this void
Stuck turning the soil
So I lay here soaking
There's sand in my bed
What a day to regret
So I leave before you go

This self sabotage
All of our other scars
Don't compare
Take the river to the sea
Drown myself so I don't sink

You took half of me, could you leave it
And go back to when we were speaking?
I hate the fact that I miss you around

Please, you won't even look at me
It's getting embarrassing, I'm crying to my family
And now I'm, I'm harder to recognize 'cause

Tell me why
How the hell I slipped your mind
You forgot me overnight
Didn't even try to hide it
All the while, lost my head and appetite
You've consumed, like, all my nights
Now I know it's unrequited

'Cause I, I took the 405

But I'm thinkin' maybe
Just maybe

With our names written on the bell
I see a picture of a family
On the kitchen windowsill
Children running in the garden
Singing 'catch me if you can'
Baby this is the plan
From the moment we met
You just don't know it yet
Yet yet
You just don't know it yet
Yet yet
I met you for a latte at your local coffeeshop
There was so much to be said that
We couldn't find the start
We were sitting there for hours
And we didn't say a lie

You gave me said the words that we did not
And I don't know if I'm crazy
But I'm thinkin' maybe
Just maybe
I see a house upon a hill
With our names written on the bell
I see a picture of a family
On the kitchen windowsill
Children running in the garden
Singing 'catch me if you can'
Baby this is the plan
From the moment we met
You just don't know it yet
Yet yet
You just don't know it yet
Yet yet
You just don't know it yet"
785,One On The Way,Jake Scott,"Heart stopped when I saw your black dress 
Long hair looked like an actress 
I was leaving I started thinking  
Of questions to ask
I took my shot to get to know you
One more tequila soda 
I said hello 
Made a bad joke 
And you faked a laugh and said 

Are you gonna buy me a drink 

Said I got one on the way
I was reading the signs
Didn't know what you'd say
But I had to try 
I knew I'd regret 
If I let you pass me by
I didn't know your name
But I loved your smile 
Some chances you take 
Change your whole life
So I bought another round
If that's okay 
I got one on the way
I got one on the way 

Six months I had no doubts 
My friends told me to slow down 
But we were falling already all in 
Knew it was meant to last
That summer I made some big plans 
Something to wear on your left hand 
We went to Paris I was talking marriage 
And you just laughed and said 

Are you gonna buy me a ring

Said I got one on the way 
I was reading the signs 
Didn't know what you'd say 
But I spent my last dime 
I knew I'd regret 
If I let you pass me by 
I knew it was fast 
But I knew it was right
Some chances you take 
Change your whole life
Wanna give you all of mine 
If that's okay 
I've got one on the way 
I've got one on the way 

One dive bar 
And one first kiss 
Who knew we'd end up like this
Life is full of turns and twists 
Like finding out
These two kids 

Got one on the way 
And for the first time 
I don't know what to say 
Looking into your eyes 
Guess the greatest things 
will catch you by surprise 
Now we're thinking of names 
We can't decide 
Crazy how one moment
Changes your whole life
And we might be scared to death but that's okay 
We got one on the way
We got one on the way 

We got one on the way"
787,Introverted,James Smith,"Remember when six weeks
Felt like a lifetime?
Swear everyday's faster now
We all know this city
Runs on caffeine and white lines
But I wanna slow it down

The suns getting low in the sky
We've reached that familiar time

But boy, don't be bad, come on
Take a step back from the window
You know you don't have to be high to get by
You're good as you are
Just take a breath
Walk through a field
Tell all the people you love how you feel
Remember, you used to be fun
But suddenly you've become
Introverted

I got a to-do list
That I never finish
And that really grinds me down
I'm pulling out chunks of my hair
And I'm well-aware
That I'm only 23 going on dead
I wanna be happy now

The suns getting low in the sky
We've reached that familiar time

But boy, don't be bad, come on
Take a step back from the window
You know you don't have to be high to get by
You're good as you are
Just take a breath
Walk through a field
Tell all the people you love how you feel
Remember, you used to be fun
But suddenly you've become
Introverted

Well, I left a bit on the side
It's staring me dead in the eye
The suns getting low in the sky
And I'm feeling lonely tonight

But boy, don't be bad, come on
Take a step back from the window
You know you don't have to be high to get by
You're good as you are
Just take a breath
Walk through a field
Tell all the people you love how you feel
Remember, you used to be fun
But suddenly you've become
Introverted"
788,Alonica,LANY(레이니),"I'm fallin' out of love with you, LA
Runnin' out of reasons I should stay
I'm overwhelmed, I'm over it
It's too cold here anyway
I'm fallin' out of love with you, LA


Back to Alonica
Where the sun is out all the time
My favorite beach is there
And the sand, it stretches for miles
Singin' la-di-di-di-da
And slowly dancin' 'til the mornin' comes
I feel most at home when I'm back in Alonica


Darlin', I have finally settled in
The water's perfect for a midnight swim
It's paradise, the stars and I
Are catchin' up like old friends
My heart is learnin' how to love again

[Chorus]
Back to Alonica
Wherе the sun is out all the time
My favoritе beach is there
And the sand, it stretches for miles
Singin' la-di-di-di-da
And slowly dancin' 'til the mornin' comes
I feel most at home when I'm back in Alonica


[Bridge]
Made up of a thousand colors
And everything is in its place
I don't know the last time there were
Tears like this upon my face
Every artist falls in wonder
Even Michelangelo
If God is really out there somewhere
This must be His other home

[Chorus]
Back to Alonica
Where the sun is out all the time
My favorite beach is there
And the sand, it stretches for miles
Singin' la-di-di-di-da
And slowly dancin' 'til the mornin' comes
I feel most at home when I'm back in Alonica"
789,Rain,Mina Okabe,"I love when it rains
Perfect excuse to let myself stay in and
Pretend I have it all under control
I don't know what I'm doing
All I do is notice everything I do wrong
Everything I do wrong
I don't want to be the reason I'm feeling stuck
Want someone to blame for being messy as fuck
Say I'm alright know it's not okay to lie
Talk about it
But can't put my thoughts into words
What is up with people making me feel worse?
I say I'm alright know it's not okay to lie
I keep on saying I'm fine
Feel bad when I complain
Wanting to be the optimist I'm seen as
Why do I wait with getting things done
Procrastinate then regret?
All I do is notice everything I do wrong
Everything I do wrong
I don't want to be the reason I'm feeling stuck
Want someone to blame for being messy as fuck
Say I'm alright know it's not okay to lie
Talk about it
But can't put my thoughts into words
What is up with people making me feel worse?
I say I'm alright know it's not okay to lie
Always say I don't need any help
Thinking I can do it all by myself
Always say I don't need any help
Think it's better is it better? Wait for better
Think it's better is it better? Wait for better
I don't want to be the reason I'm feeling stuck
Want someone to blame for being messy as fuck
Say I'm alright
Know it's not okay to lie (Not okay)
Talk about it
But can't put my thoughts into words
What is up with people making me feel worse?
I say I'm alright know it's not okay to lie

I love when it rains
Perfect excuse to let myself stay in"
791,Sad Songs In A Hotel Room,Joshua Bassett,"i’m wearing the robe
the same ones we left on the hotel floor
one year ago
do not disturb hanging on the door
how the hell we end up where we did
don’t you think it’s messed up
it all went to shit
it’s kinda depressing being here alone
i miss you so i pick up the phone
i order room service for one
champagne mini bar bottles are done
i’ve got a balcony room with a view
velvet curtains are closed 
singing sad songs in a hotel room
oh
where i once held you 
i’m singing sad songs in a hotel room
neighbors are knocking they just wanna sleep
it’s 3am while my guitar gently weeps
i flip through these old magazines
dream destinations we promised we see
how the hell we end up where we did
in one year it all went to shit
i order room service for one
champagne mini bar bottles are done
i’ve got a balcony room with a view
velvet curtains are closed 
singing sad songs in a hotel room
oh
where i once held you 
i’m singing sad songs in a hotel room
we checked in together
i never checked out
guess it’s heartbreak hotel
cause just look at us now
i order room service for one
champagne mini bar bottles are done
i’ve got a balcony room with a view
velvet curtains are closed 
singing sad songs in a hotel room
oh
where i once held you 
i’m singing sad songs in a hotel room"
792,Dangerously Easy,Olivia Dean,"Old flame where do you love from?
Explain how did you find your way?
This happiness suits you
A job you don't hate
Painting the town with your mates
And an arm full of bad tattoos
You make it look easy
Dangerously easy you do
Old flame where did she come from?
That face smiling in my place
This happiness suits you
She's probably the one
Gets on so well with your Mum
And all the way down to Earth (Earth)
You make it look easy (Easy)
Dangerously easy (Easy) you do
But I'm still stuck in my own way
Always choosing the hard way
It feels like every time
I try taking it easy
I don't even believe me
And you just burn the same
Old flame where do I get something true?
What have I got to do to make it look easy?
(Easy)
Dangerously easy (Easy)
To make it look easy (Easy)
Dangerously easy (Easy)
Like you?"
793,Stop Waiting,Cigarettes After Sex(시가렛 애프터 섹스),"In her favorite locket hiding yellow pills
With white wine to chase them
Lying on the hills
We kissed until we couldn't breathe
The coldest sand is on the beach
Now she's in her swimsuit
With the yellow stripes
Cutting it with scissors 'til there's nothing left
And rubbing sunscreen on her dress
She's putting on sunglasses
I could win I could lose
But that's a look I can't refuse
I could win I could lose
But that's a look I can't refuse
Stop waiting
I could win I could lose
But that's a look I can't refuse
I could win I could lose

Stop waiting"
794,The Way It Was Before,Johnny Stimson,"Feels like yesterday
I was living at my parents' house
I blinked and things changed
Fast forward and I was moving out
I can only exist in three dimensions at a time
Who am I to resist a river flowing left to right?
It's like we've been dancing in the dark
A great big expansion from a spark
Over in a moment
Finished in a flash
Slipping through my fingers
Life's an hourglass
Shattered on the floor oh
It'll never be the way it was before
No
Feels like yesterday
I was falling in love
Then came the heartbreak
Like it always does
Nobody escapes it
Time's a losing game
Might as well embrace it
'Till it flies away
I know that nobody can stay forever young
I wish I could just take a break
from growing up
It's like we've been dancing in the dark
A great big expansion from a spark
Over in a moment
Finished in a flash
Slipping through my fingers
Life's an hourglass
Shattered on the floor oh
It'll never be the way it was before
The way it was before
Over in a moment
Finished in a flash
Slipping through my fingers
Moving way too fast
Wish I had just a little more oh
It'll never be the way it was before"
796,Heartbreak Anniversary,Giveon,"Balloons are deflated
Guess they look lifeless like me
We miss you on your side of the bed mmm
Still got your things here
And they stare at me like souvenirs
Don't wanna let you out my head
Just like the day that I met you
The day I thought forever
Said that you love me
But that'll last for never
It's cold outside like
When you walked out my life
Why you walk out my life?
I get like this every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary
'Cause I remember every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary
Do you ever think of me?
I'm buildin' my hopes up
Like presents unopened to this day
I still see the messages you read mmm
I'm foolishly patient
Can't get past the taste of your lips
Don't wanna let you out my head
Just like the day that I met you
The day I thought forever
Said that you love me
But that'll last for never
It's cold outside like
When you walked out my life
Why you walk out my life?
I get like this every time

798,Comeback,Albert Posis,"Torn inside my brain
Cause I lost sight of such a simple feeling
And I know we went our separate ways
But this was all just one misunderstanding
And I put it on you
I didn't know any better
Weighing all the pressure
Shouldn't have left you on your own
Honey I don't deserve this feeling
Hope you know that I won't
Keep you from leaving
Yeah I know that it sounds cliche
But you're still my day one
Yeah I'm coming back
Cause it's comeback season
My mind was always changing
Didn't notice that my motives
Were in vices in bad places
But I'm better where my headspace is
Took some time to reassess the situation
Trying to lose this bad reputation
In all of my times of desperation
You were the one waiting
Honey I don't deserve this feeling
Hope you know that I won't
Keep you from leaving
Yeah I know that it sounds cliche
But you're still my day one
Yeah I'm coming back
Cause it's comeback season
Baby it's time
For you to know that I'm for real
I'm done with hiding how I feel
So let's just go up from here
Cause honey you should know that I don't
Honey I don't deserve this feeling
Hope you know that I won't
Keep you from leaving
Yeah I know that it sounds cliche
But you're still my day one
Yeah I'm coming back
Cause it's comeback season"

To show me where you are
Come find me
I'm ready to be caught off guard so
If you're down to let me in entirely and inspire me
This maze could be a work of art
We both can't control
If the answer's yes or no
When your heart's ready for the truth
Maybe that's when I'll get to you
Something about me wants to know your soul
(Tell me what I want to hear)
I can't explain the way I'm feeling
(Don't wanna get close when you're near)
Your mind is something I'm not reading yet
Tell me why I always gravitate to you
Can we navigate
Open up the gates
Come closer
I feel a type of way
And I can't keep my composure
Drifting towards me
We can slowly move
Further away from the start
Cause we know
We both can't control
If the answer's yes or no
When your heart's ready for the truth
Maybe that's when I'll get to you
Something about you
Wants to know my soul
(Tell me what I want to hear)
baby I can't explain the way I'm feeling
(Don't wanna get close when you're near)
Your mind is something I'm not reading yet
Tell me why I always gravitate to you

I see through it
Energy, receptive so I keep my click exclusive
You gotta do it

Some people just hate and talk
They haven't really done much work
And only ever see the worst
Naturally inclined to love
But when the love ain't flowing back
I pull away and reassess
Gotta protect me

Push the negative to the side
So it's not in front of my eyes
Outta sight, outta mind
I need more than 50 feet
If your mind, body, soul ain't aligned
I don't need you messing with mine
Outta sight, outta mind
I need more than 50 feet

Protección te pido, abuelita
Ven, cuídame
Cuando el mundo me quita la fe

Say a prayer when I'm feeling afraid

Some people just hate and talk
They haven't really done much work
And only ever see the worst, oh

My heart ain't on fire like
It used to be
Don't feel it anymore

Tried to hold your love a thousand times
But you never made it easy
And I
Let you drag me way over the line

And now you're turning into coal
Things I tell myself are getting old
Cause lately
I been thinking bout you
And little bit differently

Lately
My heart ain't on fire like

I kept you cause I never knew my worth
Without having you by my side

We gotta stop debating

I'll see you in the morning
I'll go wherever you're going

I don't need to side
Even if I had to choose
You know I'd rather be
With no one else but you
One day you will find
I'm gonna make it true
And if you don't believe then we concede
Defeat for me is inconceivable
But all I think about is what's achievable
Despite it mightn't be feasible
Can't stop a man from dreaming
I don't wanna waste this feeling
Excuse the way I'm being
Putting it all on a plate and
Wrapping it up in a bow yeah
I can't complicate it (Oh)

Soaring in the dark of the night
You touched down
To be mine for a little while
You know I wanna hold you close
But sometimes love is letting go
The moon won't ever tell the sun that it can't rise
And if there's one thing that I know
Love is losing all control
But if you have to leave
Then I'll leave on the light
And if you come back I'll be waiting
If you come back I'll be right there by your side
If you come back I'll be waiting
If you come back I'll be right here every time
We burn through life
Faster than a wildfire
Can we stay frozen in time
In between hello and goodbye
You know I wanna hold you close
But sometimes love is letting go
The moon won't ever tell the sun that it can't rise
And if there's one thing that I know
Love is losing all control
But if you have to leave
Then I'll leave on the light
And if you come back I'll be waiting

If you come back I'll be waiting
If you come back I'll be right here every time"

No matter how I try
I wanted closure
Wish you were closer so you hear the things I say

Cause I'm still longing
Now you are too far
Day after day
I'm tryin' my best to live without you and
Now I'll be my own star
Day after day
I'm tryin' to find, another you in someone new
(Day after day I)
I am still here without you
(Day after day I)
Life is boring without you
(Day after day I)
I am still here without you
(Day after day I)
Life is boring without you

It begins
In the cold late night
Till early morning
I do believe that
Overthinking comes rightly
At those hours
3 or 4 AM, but I'm not sure
Yes, cause I'm not sure"
819,Love You Anymore,Devin Kennedy,"Feels like we've been here before
One too many times
Doing like we always do
We were in heaven
But heaven fell through
I guess love is a catch 22

Swear that we've been here before
It's harder every time
Two people playing pretend
We rewrite the pages
Again and again
But even the best stories end

So I'll make it easy
Yea, I'll take the blame
I'll let you hate me
To help ease the pain
I'm stuck on this feeling
I just can't explain
I used to be sure
But I don't think I love you anymore

I wish that I could hold you close
To fix a broken heart
Cause we know the magic is gone
But you're gonna find it with someone i'm not
And they're gonna love you a lot

And in 20 years I'll think of you
And wonder where you are
I know that you'll think of me too
We'll replay the memories
That only we knew
I'll always be grateful for you

So I'll make it easy
Yea, I'll take the blame
I'll let you hate me
To help ease the pain
I'm stuck on this feeling
I just can't explain
I used to be sure
But I don't think I love you anymore

I used to be sure
But I don't think I love you"
824,Margaux,Matilda Mann,"Another day another room
With nothing new to say
But pretty eyes to match the sky
And softness in her face
She can't decide and never cries
I think it's just her style
Margaux stay a little while

Countless hours spent outside
To waste her time away
And over bearing endless staring
Into out of space
I can't recall the time before
I felt so out of place
Margaux left without a trace

Sunday mornings
Are quieter these days
And when do I
Get back the time we wasted
We both know
There's no one else to blame
Margaux left and nothing felt the same

Another meal in silence
And I don't know what to make
My room is still a mess
And my hair is just the same
I contemplate and wait for something
Just to make me move
Margaux said I'd never loose

Sunday mornings
Are quieter these days
And when do I
Get back the time we wasted
We both know
There's no one else to blame
Margaux left and nothing felt
Margaux left it's for the best
Margaux left and everything has changed"
831,blind,lullaboy,"Do your worst
Say it's who you are
Call me over
Add one more scar
Still I don't mind
I know you'll change
What would I be if I walked away
I believe
We were meant to be
I'm facing the demons inside of me
You kiss me slow
You tuck me in
I stay home and slip my jacket on again while
You go down by the river
I give you what you're needing
But I'm tired of always bleeding
I watch as you're slipping away
And darling
You know we're meant for each other
I'll take my time
You're one of a kind
Or maybe I'm blind
I'll explain
Now I'll face the truth
If there's hope for you
Then there's hope for me too
We circle round
It's just one more game
Maybe I'll try this just
One more day and
No thats not what I need
I'll start thinking bout me
No one chooses the person I have to be
I'll try to let you go
i'll run away from you
I'll learn how to love
and be loved by somebody new while
You go down by the river
I give you what you're needing
But I'm tired of always bleeding
I watch as you're slipping away
And darling
You know we're meant for each other
I'll take my time
You're one of a kind
Or maybe I'm blind"
832,Glue Song (feat. Clairo),beabadoobee,"I've never known someone like you
Tangled in love stuck by you
From the glue
Don't forget to kiss me
Or else you'll have to miss me
I guess I'm stuck forever by the glue
Oh and you
You've been hiding in plain sight
And it appeared oh I know
Loving you once only feels wrong
I need you
I always knew I'd find you
To be here is worth the wait to
I'm not lying
When I say I've been stuck
By the glue onto you
I've been stuck by glue
Right onto you
I've been stuck by glue
I've never known
I've never known someone like you
I've never known
I've never known someone like you"

劣等感に侵された心を手放して

迷う旅路に立つ　瞳の奥に 
隠した弱さも　いま晒していく

照らす世界で奇跡を見たい

それならばもういっそ 走り切る 今を 君と
わからないことばかり溢れてる それが何?
そんなステキな世界を私たち二人で
一緒に笑って迷子になろう
「迷子の最後」を確かめにいこう
間違い続ける僕が 君を見つけたことだけは
何万の間違いなんか 帳消し起死回正解だった
痛みを超える強さとか 絶望も黙る希望とか
君がいなきゃ一つとて 知ることのない光
どれだけ違っているかより
たった一つだけでいい
この宇宙で僕らだけが知る 絆があれば
八方塞がって がんじがらめも慣れっこの運命
君と出逢って これもまたいっかななんて思えて
「自分」をなんでか選べず生まれ落ちた僕ら
せめて生きている間だけのたった一つは
選びたいの 君じゃないと もう離さないよ

861,come to my stu (Feat. 릴러말즈) (Remix),크루셜스타 (CRUCiAL STAR),"어제 기억이 흐릿해
눈 떠보니 거실등 밑에
누워있어 여긴 대체 어딘데
다시 눈 떠보니 나는 여기에

Time Machine 에서 내려 앞을 보니
환호 소리
꼬집어보는 볼
man I'm on the road to riches
뒤엔 콰이올린
내가 해낼거라 믿었지 난 당연히
이제는 즐겨 너의 chat
사랑을 줄게 to my haters
그래 뭐 떠들라고 해
나는 왔다고 next level
aespa 처럼
예습한대로 매순간 I trust myself
가슴 안엔 새겨놔
Carpe Diem 하나만
미로 같던 삶은 이제 정원으로 변했기에
곡에 물을 주는 중이야 근처 오면 연락해
요즘 따라 자주 널 생각해 do you miss me
싱잉랩 좀 할게 쌓인 게 많아서 you feel me

어제 기억이 흐릿해
눈 떠보니 거실등 밑에
누워있어 여긴 대체 어딘데
다시 눈 떠보니 나는 여기에

I don't wanna be okay
너가 없인 비옥해지지 않아
나의 마음은 갈라지고 있어 매일
내가 왜 이렇게까지 했겠어
지금 뭐해
작업실로 와볼래
너는 깜짝 놀래
you better catch up
마이크 앞에서 외쳤었던 나의 성공은
이중적 의미 Date, Just
떳떳하게 너의 앞에 선 나를 상상해온
길었던 시간을 달려서 온
이곳은 LA LA LAND
아직 난 더 가야해
친구도 만나야해
티켓 두 장 사야해
목적지는 Paris행
꿈을 꾸다보면 나의 Studio는 Ghibli
LAPUTA가 되어서 날아왔지 여긴 구름 위
all eyes on me
now you see me on TV
내 타이밍은 오지
밤새 했으니 준비

862,마지막 장 (Feat. 경제환),아우릴고트 (OUREALGOAT),"마지막 날처럼
함께했었던
기억도 다 이제는 의미 없겠지
마지막 장처럼
넘겨지고 나면
너에게 난 아무런 의미도 없게 되겠지
가끔 정말 힘들어 홀로 남아보면
유행한다는 드라마도 몰아보면
머릿속에는 가득해 네 걱정
네가 떠난 뒤 망가졌어 벌써
여전히 널
절대로 못 잊어
널 위해서라면 밤새 할 수 있어
그만해줘 관두잔 그 말
너에게 돌아갈게 금방
그땐
영원할 줄 알았지
그대로
변하지 않을 사이처럼
너와 난
마지막 날처럼
함께했었던
기억도 다 이제는 의미 없겠지
마지막 장처럼
넘겨지고 나면
너에게 난 아무런 의미도 없게 되겠지
마지막 장을 넘기고
에필로그
어쩌다 보니 많아진 페이지
그때 난
마지막
그런 말
관심 밖
오늘만 봤어 널 사랑하기도 바빠
애써 다른 하룰 만들고
애써 다른 사람을 만나고
뭘 해봐도 왜
나타나니 매일
때 탄 서울엔 네가 베여있어
그땐
영원할 줄 알았지
umm
그대로
변하지 않을 사이처럼
마지막 날처럼
함께했었던
기억도 다 이제는 의미 없겠지
마지막 장처럼
넘겨지고 나면

863,정리,태리 (Terry),"서랍에 넣어둔
그 편지를 읽으면
괜히 널 떠올릴 테니까
쓰레기통에 던져버렸어
아무 말도
난 꺼내지 못하고서
널 보내버렸어
그땐 뭔가
말하면 실수할 것 같아서
난 못해줬어 너에게 많은 걸
바란 건 없다했지만 내 마음이 아픈 걸
이제 와서 후회해도
돌이킬 순 없잖아
같은 영환 다시 본다 해도 반전은 없잖아
거짓이 된 웃음에 멈춰버린 사진도
너의 취향으로 바꿨던 내 옷차림도
지워보려해 더 이상 의미가 없잖아
그땐 널 안아줬던 내가
이제는 아무것도 못해주는 게 너무 미안해
어떻게든 정리하려고 해
이젠 텅 비어버린 내 방
구석에 쌓인 먼지마저도 모두 비워내
깔끔하게 정리하려고 해
널 정리하려고 해
절대 후회하지 않아
애써 붙잡아둔 추억에
낭비한 시간만
아까울 뿐이지
나눠 낀 이어폰처럼
한 귀로 듣고 흘렸던 거야
약속 따위는 전부 다
꺼내버렸지
꺼냈고 버렸지 미련은
없애버렸지
없애고도 버렸지 기억을
우리 만나기 전으로 돌아가
어쩌면 나 혼자 지레 겁먹고 도망가는 걸지도
깔끔하게 널 비워낸 공간에 혼자
몰랐네 생각보다 허전했구나
웃고 있는 우리 사진들을 보면서
나도 모르게 미소가 번지고 말았어
난 모르겠어 어떻게 해야 돼
내 머릿속의 너는 정리가 안돼
알아서 돌아가던가
다시금 돌아와 주던가 해
그땐 널 안아줬던 내가
이제는 아무것도 못해주는 게 너무 미안해
어떻게든 정리하려고 해
이젠 텅 비어버린 내 방
구석에 쌓인 먼지마저도 모두 비워내
깔끔하게 정리하려고 해
다 정리하려고 했지만
너 없는 이곳은 공허해
놓아주지 못해서 미안해
결국 되돌릴 순 없겠지만
다 정리하려고 했지만
너 없는 이곳은 공허해
놓아주지 못해서 미안해
쓰레기통을 뒤적거리네"
864,흑백영화 (Prod. BOYCOLD),릴러말즈 (Leellamarz),"한 장면 같네
너가 대답할 때
간직하고 싶고
얘기하기엔 깊어
영화 같네
네 곁을 떠날 때
이게 맞나 싶고
돌이킬 순 없어
우린 영화 같은 얘기 속에 어디쯤일까
어쩌면 다음 장면쯤에 다시 잘 어울릴까
전부 태워 타고나면 이건 재일 뿐일까
우린 영화 같은 얘기 속에 어디쯤일까
한 장면 같네
필름 속에
너의 웃는 모습도
볼수록 슬퍼
영화 같네
많이 하는 이맘때
사랑인가 싶고
돌이킬 순 없어
우린 영화 같은 얘기 속에 어디쯤일까
어쩌면 다음 장면쯤에 다시 잘 어울릴까
전부 태워 타고나면 이건 재일 뿐일까
우린 영화 같은 얘기 속에 어디쯤일까
아마도 다시는
보고 싶지 않은
너의 모습이라
너무 아픈 장면이라
비록 더는 색이 없어도
사랑이 없어도
지금 보고 있는 이 영화는 우리 얘기일까
우린 영화 같은 얘기 속에 어디쯤일까
어쩌면 다음 장면쯤에 다시 잘 어울릴까
전부 태워 타고나면 이건 재일 뿐일까
우린 영화 같은 얘기 속에 어디쯤일까"
867,Big Jet Plane,Valley,"An angel cries on my shoulder
And I leave at four in the mourning
I'm so stressed out
I'm so stressed out
She says, ""Sleep when you're older
Keep me up and come a little closer""
Can't hear me say
I'm going away


Life feels lonely on a big jet plane
Heart feels hollow with the big suitcase
I wanna bring you baby, but I just can't stand
I'm going away, going away, going away
See you everywhere, everywhere I go
Hotel rooms never feel like home
I wanna hold you, baby, but I just can't stay
I'm going away, going away, going away




To collapse in our bed
And rеlax on my chest
While you scracht my head
And that turns into sеx
I know we're gonna be ok
I've been simple when we hideaway
But we both got dreams that we gotta chase
So I need to go
I'm going away

Life feels lonely on a big jet plane
Heart feels hollow with the big suitcase
I wanna bring you baby, but I just can't stand
I'm going away, going away, going away
See you everywhere, everywhere I go
Hotel rooms never feel like home
I wanna hold you, baby, but I just can't stay
I'm going away, going away, going away


Life gets lonely on a big jet plane
Heart feels hollow with a big suitcase
I wanna bring you, baby, but I just can't stay
I'm going away, going away, going away
See you everywhere, everywhere I go
Hotel rooms never feel like home
I wanna hold you, baby, but I just can't stay

872,Is It Too Soon,Chris James,"Send me your location, i'll catch the next flight
One month of vacation, they gave us some time
I'm daring to say this, all channels go quiet
We pushed it in motion, now
Did i give up on myself
to see the highest prices paid?
You don't know how much it kills me
to see every signal fade
Is it too soon to burn the sheets
and buy a new bed?
Is it too soon to toss all of the pictures you left?
Said it's better for my health
Is it better? i can't tell
Is it too soon to live life without you?
Is it too soon to tell my mom it didn't work out?
I'll make up new rules
Speed up time, i drink and black out
Said it's bettеr for my health
Is it better? i can't tеll
Is it too soon to live life without you?
Yeah
Is it too soon to live life without you?
This time i'm not gonna fight it,
tell me every reason why
Sorry that i tried to change you,
guess the fault is all mine
See, your eyes are like an ocean,
i was swallowed by the tide
I was moving on but honestly our rivers ran dry
Guess it's easier to leave
if your perspective has changed
Was i talking in my sleep?
i made some progress today
I can see you now
'cause i ran out of shit i could say
Don't know what else it wuld take, yeah yeah
Is it too soon to burn the sheets
and buy a new bed?
Is it too soon to toss all of the pictures you left?
Said it's better for my health
Is it better? i can't tell

Is it too soon to live life without you?
Is it too soon to see you go with somebody else?
Don't wanna lose you,
one more month of going through hell
Said it's better for my health

881,Not Going Anywhere,Keren Ann(케렌 앤),"This is why I always wonder
I'm a pond full of regrets
I always try to not remember 
rather than forget

This is why I always whisper
When vagabonds are passing by
I tend to keep myself away 
from their goodbyes

Tide will rise and fall along the bay
and I'm not going anywhere
I'm not going anywhere
People come and go and walk away
but I'm not going anywhere
I'm not going anywhere

This is why I always whisper
I'm a river with a spell
I like to hear but not to listen
I like to say but not to tell

This is why I always wonder
There's nothing new under the sun
I won't go anywhere 
so give my love to everyone

Tide will rise and fall along the bay
and I'm not going anywhere
I'm not going anywhere
People come and go and walk away
but I'm not going anywhere
I'm not going anywhere

I learned that the hard way
Hard way to say goodbye

As much as I could do
I won't hold back these tears tonight
All alone to myself
I hope you know that I'm going crazy
I honestly don't know how much I can take

I thought that it would be 
easier than this
I found my heart had grown colder
But the warmth of your kiss 
I can't dismiss

Though my past has left me bruised
I ain't hiding from the truth
When the truth won't 
let me lie right next to you

And it's holding strong
Even though I tried to make it
Played the part but I can't fake it
It keeps holding on
And it's holding strong
Even though I tried to break it
Heaven knows that I can't shake it

I've seen times that were harder
I remember the taste of bitterness
Won't you help me my father?
Help me fall in the love 
that I have missed

Though my past has left me bruised
I ain't hiding from the truth
When the truth won't 
let me lie right next to you

887,grateful,Dhruv,"Heaven only knows I've been down
Couldn't see the sun behind the clouds
Wondered if it'd ever come out again
Snug inside the arms of loneliness
Nineteen candles out before we kissed
Nights of my youth hardly missed
But I say whoever wrote this story
crafted one hell of an arc
The bits of me I couldn't stand
are my favorite parts
Never used to take the time to recognize
Everything I need is right in my line of sight
And I don't know my destination
but I've come to learn
The universe gives you the answers
on it's own terms
Through the highs and through the lows
I look up to the sky
I know the world is mine
I feel so fucking grateful
I'm so so fucking grateful
We took the long way 'round
Been in the lost and found
I feel so fucking grateful
I'm just so fucking grateful
Yeah heaven really knows I overthink
Do a thousand takes and pick the fifth
Get overwhelmed by every little thing
(Little thing little thing)
Remember being a kid and wild and free
Playing Rapunzel from the balcony
Thinking I didn't care how you'd see me
Good day
Yeah we're sitting on a park bench
in the thick of spring
I write these words and watch the daffodils
sway in the wind
Never used to take the time to look around
Pay attention to the different layers of sound
It's so funny
how we run to where we need to be
That we never get to take in the scenery
I don't wanna live my life that way
I look up to the sky
I know the world is mine
I feel so fucking grateful
I'm so so fucking grateful
We took the long way 'round
Been in the lost and found
I feel so fucking grateful
I'm just so fucking grateful
Yeah I don't want this day to end
We watch the sun make its descent
I ask if you've got somewhere else to be
We talk into the dead of night
Share history in the dwindling light
And thank the stars for here is
where we've reached"

890,Sundays (feat. Loony),Jon Vinyl,"Sunday's don't always go my way
But someday I hope they'll all be fine
Cause monday's like a kick in my face
A wake up call
Saying go get everything you love
See I'm a reminiscent extrovert
Who finds a way to speak
My past and my present
Has a lot to do with me
So I wake up every morning
Have a coffee or a tea
And write a song
And play a beat
The pressure burns
Guess that's how
It feels when you ain't regular
I've been onto something
Young black and triumphant
Only blessings first
Hope you get the message word
Life is full of lessons learned
Now fridays feel like summer
Saturdays are spring and
Thursday's I just eat
Tuesday's and my wednesday's
All I wanna do
Is sleep (All I wanna do is sleep)
Sunday's don't always go my way
But someday I hope they'll all be fine
Cause monday's like a kick in my face
A wake up call
Saying go get everything you love
Loony refrain
Someday I wanna wake up on
The sunny side of a sunday sunday
Someday I wanna wake up
On the sunny side of a sunday

La da da da da da
La da da da da da ayeeee"
891,once in a moon,Sarah Kang,"'For the first time I would like my name
Just because of the way you say it
And I would memorize every line and hair
To remember when you aren't there
We would walk along a tree-lined street
With a breeze dancing at our feet
And we would sing a song in harmony
If only you hadn't left me
So I'll think of you once in a moon
When I hear your favorite tune
And someday after a year or two
Maybe then I won't be loving you
I'll think of you once in a moon
When I see someone who looks like you
And someday after a year or two
Maybe then I'll still be loving you
We would say goodbye just to say hello again
And we would get in fights just to get over them
We would be alright
even if things don't stay the same
If only you had stayed
So I'll think of you once in a moon
When I hear your favorite tune
And someday after a year or two
Maybe then I won't be loving you
I'll think of you once in a moon
When I see someone who looks like you
And someday after a year or two
Maybe then I'll still be loving you
What if I had bit my tongue
What if what we had was enough
I guess all my calculations were off
When I thought I would get over you
It doesn't make sense
But I'd do it all again
I'll think of you once in a moon
When I hear your favorite tune
And someday after a year or two
Maybe then I won't be loving you
I'll think of you once in a moon
When I see someone who looks like you
And someday after a year or two
Maybe then I'll still be loving you'"
893,Someone Like You,Anthony Lazaro,"I never knew
A winter day could be warm
Until I found you
Into the storm, I never knew
A windy night could be sweet
Until you swept me off from my feet
The rain sings
Cop smiles
He fines me but with style
The car got a flat tire, but riding shotgun I've someone like you
So everyday
When the alarm blows my ears
I see you sleeping and the buzzing clears and everytime
Everything seems to go wrong
You know your voice sounds just like a song
The rain sings
The cop smiles
He fines me but with style
The car got a flat tire
But riding shotgun I've someone like you
Someone like you
Take something bad
Give it a spin and turn it on its head
Someone like you it's worth like gold
After they made you they simply broke the mold
The rain sings and the cop smiles
He fines me but with style
The car got a flat tire, but riding shotgun
I've someone like you"

Smoke for two

Let me feel it again
Got it bad

I was blind

Eyes wide shut can they foresee
The four sides
Of my type

Yes I'm blind
Want it bad
Stuck with my many motives

897,Be Kind,Zak Abel,"La, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
 La, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la

 It don't bother me if you're old or young
 If you got lots of money or you got next to none
 Or where you think we all go when we die

 It ain't on my mind if you're big or small
 How long it takes you to get up when you fall
 Or if you can or cannot handle the spice

 In a world where you can be anything
 I'll be kind to you
 Could you be kind to me?
 Kind to me

 It's all I'm asking

 La, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
 La, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
 (Could you be kind to me?)

 (Could you be kind? Could you be kind to me?)
 La, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
 (Could you be kind? Could you be kind?)

 It don't bother me what SPF you use
 Or if the body you're born in don't define you
 We're all taking different ways into Rome
 If you get off to guys, girls, both kind
 Or someone in between
 Or like to dress up even when it ain't Halloween
 I don't mind, I say each to their own

 In a world where you can be anything
 I'll be kind to you
 Could you be kind to me?
 Kind to me

 It's all I'm asking

 La, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
 (Could you be kind?)

 (Could you be kind? Could you be kind to me?)
 La, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
 (Could you be kind? Could you be kind?)

 If there's one thing in this life that is guaranteed
 It's you and I might see a few things differently

 In a world where you can be anything
 I'll be kind to you
 Could you be kind to me?

 La, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la

I feel the words a voice dryin' my eyes
I think a driver might've saved my night

Each line sounds like it was read right
Right outta my mind how do they know?

899,Going Up The Coast,Clay And Friends,"I was going up the coast
In a minivan that broke
Like my voice when I told you I was leaving
Pack my bag up sick of home
Never homesick down that road
In my room by the moon with no ceiling
I was driving in a van I was older than
I and I plus five heading Kanye West
Off the tip of Argentina
Better than drowning in gin
Ain't got no saint to blame instead
Of my reflection so I dreamt
I packed it all like Anderson
To end up where it all began
I was going up the coast
In a minivan that broke
Like my voice when I told you I was leaving
Pack my bag up sick of home
Never homesick down that road
In my room by the moon with no ceiling
Used to want to live in Brooklyn
With a view from my apartment
No more homies on the block like
On the corner like a stoplight yeah
On the coast they never lose it
Never showed up for the showbiz
To get back to the beginning
When I knew why I was singing
I was going up the coast
In a minivan that broke
Like my voice when I told you I was leaving
Pack my bag up sick of home
Never homesick down that road
In my room by the moon with no ceiling
Brown sugah she called me
The last time we spoke
This hard rive gone save me
She answered I know
I was going up the coast
In a minivan that broke
Like my voice when I told you I was leaving
Pack my bag up sick of home
Never homesick down that road
In my room by the moon with no ceiling

Like my voice when I told you I was leaving
Pack my bag up sick of home
Never homesick down that road

I've got my passes panoramic 
'round your fingertips

I wanted to tell ya I fell in before it's over
And I wanted to make the file 
before my trial runs out

You give me 3 dimensional feelings
Thought that I was just dreaming
Can't keep up with them all
I see 3 dimensional feelings
Bouncing off of the ceiling
Coming off of the wall

Turu turu turu turu turu turu tu I love it
Turu turu turu turu turu turu tu I do

All my emotions are explosions into stereo
I don't just feel them I convert them into audio
End of a rainbow geometric like a movie script
And now a touch feels so electric 
at my finger tips

Play to the masses
But it's hard to flex
When your Yeezys are fake
And your gold chains are plastic
So I wait wait wait

For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that
I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that
I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself"

Starts loving the sound

Start fucking around
Cos if I break the singular jack
Cause a little bit of trouble
Fill a fifth of the yack

If I finish the pact

Don't start but we feel it at the same time
Won't part but repeat it in the same shine
So dark gotta kneel it in the rain it's fine
Lost part but she's reeling 'n the blame is mine
Is mine mine mine

To another place almost anywhere
Travel to the past to try to make it last

Somewhere that's just like in outer space
And take a little time to rearrange
The image in my mind
When I last saw your face

962,Autumn Sun,Emilíana Torrini(에밀리안 토리니),"My youth stood by the harbour
Her hands set in a wave
The light now more evening than day
Now I see the beauty
I failed to see when she was me
Life undressed me of her step by step
Like a silk dress she fell to my feet
She brought me flowers
Said she liked my work
I thought she couldn't do us any harm
He never liked that kind of charm
But how could he resist
When her dress let in the autumn sun?
I used to watch the sparrows
Perched on electric wires
Like notes of a song waiting to be sung
For you I wrote them down
He laughed that laugh that kept me sane
In a world of dark dark games
She brought me flowers
Said she liked my work
I thought she couldn't do us any harm
He never liked that kind of charm
But how could he resist
When her dress let in the autumn sun?
She watered the garden
And played with the kids
For her birthday let her try on
His wedding ring
She brought me flowers
Said she liked my work
I thought she couldn't do us any harm
He never liked that kind of charm
But how could he resist
When her dress let in the autumn sun?"

Forget about your house of cards 
And I'll do mine 

Fall off the table 
Get swept under 
Denial denial 

The infrastructure will collapse 
Voltage spikes 
Throw your keys in the bowl 

Kiss your husband goodnight 

Forget about your house of cards 
And I'll do mine

967,Born For Loving You,Big Thief(빅 티프),"After the first stars formed after the dinos fell
After the first light flickered out of this motel
1991 momma pushing like hell
Tangled in blood and vine
From my first steps to my first words
To walking around looking at birds
To the teenage nightmare mine and yours
Thank God we made it through
'Cause I was born for loving you
It's just something I was made to do
Doesn't matter what dreams come true
I was born for loving you
Now we're here but where is here?
When sometimes we both disappear
Into that shadow box of fear
That tiny holed abyss
From the first kiss to the first fuck
I don't think it's just good luck
Take me to the back of your pick up truck
Show me a thing or two
'Cause I was born for loving with you
It's just something I was made to do
Doesn't matter what dreams come true
I was born for loving you
When the hard times come
And the hard times stay
When they stick around and won't go away
When it feels like
There's nothing you can do or say
Nowhere you can turn
From the last breath of my first death
To this lifetime and lifetimes left
Congratulations no regrets
It's true
I was born for loving you
It's just something I was made to do
Doesn't matter what dreams come true
I was born for loving you
I was born for loving you
It's just something I was made to do

That's seeking — pride
When the morning finds you

I belong to you
I belong to you
When you take my hand — 
I understand Where you end— 
and that's where I began —————
Deep in the night
You know, I hear your voice
When I cut the lights
And I see you there
And you're sound asleep
And it's the only time when I find peace 
'When this ends I'll find you'

I belong to you

Saying no but meaning yes

I see no reason to go ahead with it
In your eyes I see the weight
Of the planets
And it's sucking you out
Your stone looks hot as it starts to roll
We shared a meal and then you had to go
I've been over that night in my head
And you were psyching me out
I can do anything
No one is stopping me
I can be anything
But I've got the weight of the planets
I've got the weight of the planets
I'm lost
I'm so tempted I just might try
And look for you
If I know that you've arrived
In your eyes I see the weight of
The planets you're lost
And it's sucking you out"

Shining with the sheen of a shotgun (Shotgun)
Carol has a little if we need some
Joa has a ride if we wanna come
Hanging your jeans with a clothespin
Skin still wet still on my skin
Mango in your mouth juice dripping
Shoulder of your shirtsleeve slipping
Christmas eve with your mother and sis
Don't wanna fight but your mother insists
Dog's white teeth slice right through my fist
Drive to the ER and they put me on risk
Grocery store list now you get pissed
Unchecked calls and messages
I don't wanna be the owner of your fantasy
I just wanna be a part of your family
And I don't wanna talk about anything
I don't wanna talk about anything
I wanna kiss kiss your eyes again
Wanna witness your eyes looking
I don't wanna talk about anyone
I don't wanna talk about anyone
I wanna sleep in your car while you're driving
Lay in your lap when I'm crying
Circle of pine and red oak
Circle of moss and fire smoke
Fan on the ceiling like a wheel spoke
Push the clutch in and I pull the choke
Wanna listen to the sound of you blinking
Wanna listen your hands soothe
Listen to your heart beating
Listen to the way you move
And I don't wanna talk about anything
I don't wanna talk about anything
I wanna kiss kiss your eyes again
Wanna witness your eyes looking
I don't wanna talk about anyone
I don't wanna talk about anyone
I wanna sleep in your car while you're driving

Weren't we the stars in Heaven
Weren't we the salt in the sea
Dragon in the new warm mountain
Didn't you believe in me?
You held me the whole way through
When I couldn't say the words like you
I was scared indigo but I wanted to
I was scared indigo but I wanted to
And I don't wanna talk about anything
I don't wanna talk about anything
I wanna kiss kiss your eyes again

you always step to my girl

Back back way back I used to 
front like Angkor Wat
Mechanicsburg Anchorage 
and Dar es Salaam
While home in New York 
was champagne and disco
Tapes from L.A. slash San Francisco
But actually Oakland and not Alameda
Your girl was in Berkeley 
with her Communist reader
Mine was entombed within 
boom box and walkman
I was a hoarder but girl that was back then

The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out
What you on about?
I feel it in my bones, I feel it in my bones
I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house
Such a modest mouse,
I can't do it alone, I can't do it alone

Every time I see you in the world, 
you always step to my girl

Ancestors told me that their girl was better
She's richer than Croesus, 
she's tougher than leather
I just ignored all the tales of a past life
Stale conversation deserves but a bread knife
And punks who would laugh 
when they saw us together
Well, they didn't know how to dress 
for the weather
I can still see them there huddled on Astor
Snow falling slow to the sound of the master

The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out
What you on about?
I feel it in my bones, I feel it in my bones
I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house
Such a modest mouse,
I can't do it alone, I can't do it alone

Wisdoms a gift, but you'd trade it for youth
Age is an honor, it's still not the truth
We saw the stars 
when they hid from the world
You cursed the sun when 
it stepped to your girl
Maybe she's gone 
and I can't resurrect her
The truth is she doesn't 
need me to protect her
We know the true death, 
the true way of all flesh
Everyone's dying, 
but girl youre not old yet

The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out
What you on about?
I feel it in my bones, I feel it in my bones
I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house
Such a modest mouse,
I can't do it alone, I can't do it alone

The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out
What you on about?
I feel it in my bones, I feel it in my bones
I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house

I can't do it alone, I can't do it alone"

To explain the way you feel
Hide your tears with the late nights
And lots of cheap thrills
Waiting for the day
That someone could take the weight
Off your shoulders
Let it sink down twenty thousand leaves
'Cause lately on the land above
It's getting so hard to breeze
Looking for a way just to know you'll be okay
Pretty face walking on by
But I know the feeling of faking a smile
'Cause I felt that way for a long time
But here with me you can unwind
Wildflower all you need's a little sunshine
Wildflower all you need's a little sunshine
Wildflower all you need's a little sunshine
When you feel the walls start to cave in (Oh ooh)
Darling just hold on be patient (Oh ooh)
Try to remember when it's late December
The summer ain't too far away (Oh ooh)
Maybe we can turn nightmares to daydreams
Come crashing down in there safely baby
You say I'll run away but I won't oh oh oh
Pretty face walking on by
But I know the feeling of faking a smile
'Cause I felt that way for a long time
But here with me you can unwind
Wildflower all you need's a little sunshine
Stay body tight through the highs and the lows
My wildflower just watch you how you grow
Do any weather the rain and the snow
You're not alone you're not alone
But here with me you can unwind

1009,Summer Is for Falling in Love,Sarah Kang,"We could drive along
An ocean reflecting the sun
Or make a bed of
Green atop a wide open scene
Under a canvas of blue
I would draw ever nearer to you
To feel the dew on your skin
That is how it would begin
For summer is for falling in love
(Mmm)
We could stay out
Late until the sunset's past eight
And the cotton candy haze
Mirrors the warmth of your gaze
Raise your glass to mine and as we drink
We would lock eyes
So we could disregard
The thought of ever having to part
For summer is for falling in love
(Mmm)
(Ba dum)
This lightness of being
We both know to be fleeting
Like the last breath of a sunset
Right before the day is dead
But maybe the heat of today
Could keep even winter away
So I'll remember your laugh
'Cause nothing ever changes the fact
That summer is for
Falling in love (Da dum)
Summer is for falling in love"

I hate that kid you met
cause he was way too nice to you
And I'll always be nice to you
But I'm not that kid anymore
I'm hanging on by a thread
And you don't want it to end
I wish we could go back to the way it was
But I've got my own eyes
I've seen enough
All the damage
If you're gonna leave me lonely
If you're giving up on us
If you've got somebody else
Don't tell me that you love me
Remember the time
you said the there was
something wrong with me
There must be something wrong with me
cause I let you stay in my life
All of your feelings came with
all of their conditions say shut up and listen
But I didn't pay for the ride
I'm hanging on by a thread
And you don't want it to end
I wish we could go back to the way it was
But I've got my own eyes
I've seen enough
All the damage
If you're gonna leave me lonely
If you're giving up on us
If you've got somebody else
Don't tell me that you love me..
Thinking about all of the memories I'd visit
Hoping they'll just slowly fade away
Maybe it's my fault
I knew you were always vicious
I just didn't know it was a game
For you
I wish we could go back to the way it was
But I've got my own eyes
I've seen enough
All the damage
If you're gonna leave me lonely
If you're giving up on us

When I kissed your lips and felt
Saw a different side of me
It's like I didn't hate myself
At first I thought that he was just a friend
But then I heard that you were loving him
You broke my heart and
I don't really think that you mind
Build me up and turn me on
You played me like your favorite song
But I guess that you were never really mine
You made me feel like I was yours
you made me feel so insecure
But I guess that you were never really mine
Woo oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
So crossed my heart and hope to die
Never date a girl like you
After all the shit you put me through
Yeah all you ever did was lie
(pants on fire pants on fire)
Guess you can't find love in Mollywood
No you can't find love
when you're searching for better
Hope you find something better
either way it's whatever (uhh huh oh yeah)
Build me up and turn me on
You played me like your favorite song
But I guess that you were never really mine
You made me feel like I was yours
you made me feel so insecure

I'm punching my card
Eight hours, for what?
Oh, tell me what I got
I got this feeling
That time's just holding me down
I'll hit the ceiling
Or else I'll tear up this town
Tonight I gotta cut loose, footloose
Kick off your Sunday shoes
Please, Louise
Pull me up off my knees
Jack, get back
C'mon, before we crack
Lose your blues
Everybody cut footloose
You're playing so cool
Obeying every rule
Dig way down in your heart
You're burning, yearning for some
Somebody to tell you
That life ain't passing you by
I'm trying to tell you
It will if you don't even try
You can fly if you'd only cut loose, footloose
Kick off your Sunday shoes
Ooh-wee, Marie
Shake it, shake it for me
Whoa, Milo
C'mon, c'mon let's go
Lose your blues
Everybody cut footloose
cut footloose
(Oh-oh-oh-oh) cut footloose
(Oh-oh-oh-oh) cut footloose"

I guess this how it goes
That's a start, we drift apart
Then the next thing you know

You're barely holding on
And you don't know what is wrong
You're tired of sleeping back to back
You miss the feeling that you had

Are we, are we, are we lovers or are we roommates?
Are we are riding our own waves?
Now the only thing that we share is the toothpaste
Are we lovers or roommates?
Are we, are we, are we lovers or are we roommates?
Are we waiting for it to break?
Now the only thing that we share is the toothpaste
Are we lovers or roommates?

Tell me, girl, if it's too late
Are we lovers or roommates now?
Tell me, girl, if it's too late
Are we lovers or roommates?

Waking up alone
I guess Flight Mode is on
'Cause now we talk just like we are
30,000 feet apart

We were so busy changing
We forgot just how amazing
We had it, did we take it all for granted?

Are we, are we, are we lovers or are we roommates?
Are we are riding our own waves?
Now the only thing that we share is the toothpaste
Are we lovers or roommates?

Ran into your friends

I shoulda texted

I sent you a message
Maybe you missed it
Or it never went through
But it’s been one of those nights


Oh I know it’s late and you hate that I do this
Maybe it’s foolish but....

I don’t wanna talk about us
I just wanna talk about how you’ve been lately
I don’t wanna get my hopes up
Thinking that we’ll ever be together someday
I don’t need anything from you
And I know it’s a little too soon
But you and I you and I you and I you and I loved once
And I just wanna see you



Nobody said this
Would ever be easy
The way that we left it
Would have such an influence on me
Wish I could turn back time


Oh I know it’s late and you hate that I do this

Sometimes we think ahead of life
I'm telling you it don't feel right
And even if it was good
I didn't feel the way I should
To give you all that you deserve
But you took it bad and now I'm hurt

I say that's fine, you know I
Lie to keep it cool, but we'll keep being fools
So I hope you're okay, won't tell your

The first time that we met 
I thought you were the one
We were dancing at 2 AM until we saw the sun
You walked into my heart, but
Hearts don't always end up in the right place
I said goodbye to the thing that I thought I loved
I can't go back to the kiss where it all begun
I see the hurt in your face and
I wish that I could wipe it all away, and

And I tried so hard to want this
Love we're hanging on, 
but now I'm giving up, so
Trust me when I say that I've done
All that I could do, 
and maybe we're both just fools,
 and I know

I'm never gonna change your mind
And we won't ever get this right
Never forget me, heaven accept me
Just let go, oh
I'm never gonna change your mind
And I won't ever treat you right
Never forget me, heaven accept me
I'll just go, goodbye...

1038,Wish You Were Here,CL,"Lately I've been thinking about us
Blowing smoke in the air listening to Stevie
Not enough uppers too many downers
Got my mind taking dares
And sleeping ain't easy
Cuz it's been 6 months since
I last saw you but I hope you're okay
Can't believe you went from mother
To angel in the space of a day
Cant help but wonder
What does your life look like
Without me there?
Without me there?
Do I still cross your mind
Without me there?
Without me there?
Is heaven all we thought it'd be
Can you still hear my voice now
Are you watching down on me
When all I see is stars
What does your life look like
Without me there?
Wish you were here
Maybe I was too uptight
Remember when you would call
Just to say that you love me?
Honestly everything's alright
It's just me and my thoughts
Don't you worry bout a thing
And it might be late wherever
You're dreaming to the playlist we made
A bit of old school jazz and our favorite Stevie
I know some things don't change
But I still wonder
What does your life look like
Without me there?
Without me there?
Do I still cross your mind
Without me there?
Without me there?
Is heaven all we thought it'd be
Can you still hear my voice now
Are you watching down on me
When all I see is stars
What does your life look like
Without me there?
Wish you were here
흘러 버릴 시간 속 그댈 떠나보낼 마음이
영원히 난 없는걸요
Uh Uh
I've tried to move on
But I keep listening to the same songs
Just can't seem to give up on us
흘러 버릴 시간 속 그댈 떠나보낼 마음이
영원히 난 없는걸요
Uh Uh
I've tried to move on
But I keep listening to the same songs
Just can't seem to give up on us
What does your life look like
Without me there?
Without me there?
Do I still cross your mind
Without me there?
Without me there?
Is heaven all we thought it'd be
Can you still hear my voice now
Are you watching down on me
When all I see is stars
What does your life look like
Without me there?
Wish you were here
Lately I've been thinking about us
Blowing smoke in the air listening to Stevie"
1039,The Happiest Girl,BLACKPINK,"Don't hold my hand 
Don't beg me back
Don't say that we'll make it through this
If I'm so beautiful then why

The doors we slammed
The plates we smashed
Echo with the sound of madness
I can't remember why we try

My heart only wants you
The moment you say no

But tonight I'll be the happiest girl in the world
You'll see like it doesn't matter
Tonight I'll be the happiest girl in the world
You'll see like it never happened

I can stop the tears if I want to
I can stop the tears if I want to
I can stop the tears if I want to

But tonight I'll be the happiest girl in the world
You'll see like it never happened

Don't make us saints 
We're wards of pain
The past and a perfect picture
There's no one else to blame this time

Don't change the truth 
We can't undo the high 
we chase steal the crash no
You're not the one, who gets to cry

My heart only wants you
The moment you say no

But tonight I'll be the happiest girl in the world
You'll see like it doesn't matter
Tonight I'll be the happiest girl in the world
You'll see like it never happened

I can stop the tears if I want to
I can stop the tears if I want to
I can stop the tears if I want to

But tonight I'll be the happiest girl in the world
You'll see like it never happened

All it takes is a smooth pop of a bottle top 
to fix a heart 
A broken heart baby

All it takes is a little rolling paper 
take us to the start
Go back to the start

But tonight I'll be the happiest girl in the world
You'll see like it doesn't matter
Tonight I'll be the happiest girl in the world
You'll see like it never happened

I can stop the tears if I want to
I can stop the tears if I want to
I can stop the tears if I want to

But tonight I'll be the happiest girl in the world
You'll see like it never happened"

Still standing here I feel like a loner
Thinking of you
Makes me unafraid
Even if the world has been unfair to us
I'm crying in the dark
While I'm calling your name
If our story ends
What does everything mean to me?
Through pain and all the hurts
I'll keep going my way
Please remember this
You are deep in my heart
I'll be with you
Till the end of eternity
I will be your only star
Shine on you like morning star

 My God, wish
 I could be

 'Cause I'm so, so done (so done, so done)
 Guarding my tongue,
 Holding me back
 I'm living the way that I want (I want)

 'Cause I'm so, so done (so done)
 Fighting myself
 Going through hell

1043,Naked (Bonus Track),Ella Mai(엘라 마이),"Take away the big shirts the tattoos
The sweatpants and vans
Okay I don't wear no makeup
No purse in my hands
My resting bitch face is mistaken
For the mean girl
But what if I told you
There's nothing I want more in this world
Than somebody who loves me naked
Someone who never asks for love
But knows how to take it
Are you that somebody
Who sees a wall and breaks it?
Are you ready to fight just to see
What's lost behind my flaws?
Can you love me naked?
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah naked
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah naked
Oh woah yeah yeah
Might be a bitch in the mornin'
So catch me at night time
Some of my friends think I'm moody
But I think I'm just fine
I could be pissed but I'll act like I'm not
I really remember when I say I forgot
No matter how hard I try
To run away from love
At the end of the night
I need somebody who loves me naked
Someone who never asks for love
But knows how to take it
Are you that somebody
Who sees a wall and breaks it?
Are you ready to fight just to see
What's lost behind my flaws?
Can you love me naked?
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah naked
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah naked
I need someone who loves me
When I wake up
Who thinks I'm beautiful
When I'm lookin' fucked up
I want that perfect love
Am I askin' too much?
Someone who shoots for the stars
Knowin' I think
I'm not even good enough
I need somebody who loves me naked
(Who loves me naked)
Someone who never asks for love
But knows how to take it
(Knows how to take it)

Illuminated by flashing signs

Maybe I'll chill and make a grilled cheese
And go walk around the mall
Cause when I'm sippin' on the magical juice
I'm willy wonka and
I'm swimming through the colorful hues
Life is really just a lemon
That you don't get to choose
And that's alright

Watch you given all your money
For such a precious story
My life is treated usual good then goodbye
To our memories
Sitting down with cigarettes of ours
Take it easy for a little while
You know he did everything good so far
Our fragmented love and cry
We suddenly turn into dust and die
I said it oooh
If you're my only friend
Can you stay up on my pain
The memories and the smell of she remains
In my memories
Sitting down with cigarettes of ours
Take it easy for a little while

1050,Summer Is for Falling in Love,Sarah Kang,"We could drive along
An ocean reflecting the sun
Or make a bed of
Green atop a wide open scene
Under a canvas of blue
I would draw ever nearer to you
To feel the dew on your skin
That is how it would begin
For summer is for falling in love
(Mmm)
We could stay out
Late until the sunset's past eight
And the cotton candy haze
Mirrors the warmth of your gaze
Raise your glass to mine and as we drink
We would lock eyes
So we could disregard
The thought of ever having to part
For summer is for falling in love
(Mmm)
(Ba dum)
This lightness of being
We both know to be fleeting
Like the last breath of a sunset
Right before the day is dead
But maybe the heat of today
Could keep even winter away
So I'll remember your laugh
'Cause nothing ever changes the fact
That summer is for
Falling in love (Da dum)
Summer is for falling in love"

1054,This Time Of Year,Rhys Lewis,"There's an angel on the tree
Presents on the floor
Mistletoe above the kitchen door
And the kids are playing games
And the turkey's going gold
Mariah Carey's on the radio
I'm pouring everybody a drink
But I'm holding back the tears as I think about
How Grandad liked the whiskey
And Grandma liked the gin
And Uncle Johnny wasn't fussed
He'd drink anything
So let's raise a glass to all those
We wish were sitting here
The ones we miss the most this time of year
Well, I still hear their voices laughing
At the Christmas-cracker jokes
See their footsteps sinking in the snow
'Cause all the magic in December
Seems to bring them back to life
For a moment they're all with me, by my side
I'm pouring everybody a drink
But I'm holding back the tears as I think about
How Grandad liked the whiskey
And Grandma liked the gin
And Uncle Johnny wasn't fussed
He'd drink anything
So let's raise a glass to all those
We wish were sitting here
The ones we miss the most this time of year
And let's make sure we're making memories good enough to last
Let's make this year the best we've ever had
'Cause one day I'll be laughing with you somewhere from the past
So will you raise a glass for me
You know I like a whiskey
And mum, she likes a gin
Our little cousin's still too young
But maybe just a sip
And let's all enjoy the moment
Before it disappears
With the ones we love the most this time of year
Let's raise a glass to all those
We wish were sitting here
The ones we miss the most this time of year"

Fightin' for my trust
And you won't back down
Even if we gotta risk it all right now oh

Sad faces all around me

I can feel the pain yeah
Broke car broke phone
Broke bank broke home
Heart broke and I can't believe
That I'm in this again
I'm looking forward to my bed tonight
Turn my pillow to the colder side
I'd do anything to close my eyes
And feel alive til the stars align
When all of my dreams
Wanna go for a walk
And I don't wanna talk about the day
I wanna end
So could you remember
To wait to wake me up again
Just another one of those days
In the worst way
You don't know babe
I've been looking forward to
Being with you tonight
Tell me how your day's been
How your work went
Was it any different?
Cos I've been on a roller coaster ride
Take me out
And tuck me in into your love tonight
Keep you close into the morning light
I'd do anything to hold you tight
And feel alive til the stars align
When all of my dreams
Wanna go for a walk
And I don't wanna talk about the day
I wanna end
So could you remember
To wait
When all of my dreams
Wanna go for a walk
And I don't wanna talk about the day
I wanna end

When we were young you were always with your friends
Wanted to grab your hand and run away from them

So I made a move, I took your hand
My heart was beating loud like I've never felt before
You were smiling at me like you wanted more
I think you're the one I've never seen before

That you'll be the one
And I'll be the guy who'll be on his knees
To say I love you
And I need you
And say I'd die for you (Just give me your forever)

[Verse 1]
I never knew
It would be possible
For you to be with me
'Cause you loved someone else back in '73
I was so jealous seeing you with him
Oh baby, I know that I can treat you better back in those nights
Oh you wouldn't cry from his stupid lies
Oh baby, I was there watching wishing you to be mine


[Chorus]
I want you to know
I love you the most
I'll always be there right by your side
'Cause baby, you're always in mind
Just give me your forever (Give me your forever)

I was on the aisle
Waiting for you, babe
Saw you in your gown
I was crying all my tears
I told myself that you are the one

I love you the most
I'll always be there right by your side

But you let me get this far

But my parents they ain't getting any younger
I can't ignore the truth
That everyday that passes by

Stay awake till I get home

But you'd always let me know
It's just hard to imagine
A world without you there
Who's gonna leave a light on?
Who will be waiting by the stairs?

Wish I could get back the time I wasted

Blaming everybody else for my pain

But hear me out, I didn't feel pretty good
Oh, I got so fed up, I misunderstood
What was really important, what I had to get sorted
How I was meant to grow up

Mistakes that we learned from
The choices that we made
I know that I hurt some
And I'm left to blame

'Cause I've played my games, I've sunk my ship
And there are still some voices whispering
My shadow's staying near, tryna get me down
But I know better, I know better now

I was locked up, shackled in chains
Heavy breathin' bringing smoke to my brain
Everybody tellin' me I'm insane
Now I know that it sounds pretty strange

Mistakes that we learned from
The choices that we made

1075,Lifetime,Faime,"I met you in the summer
When you moved here from Ann Arbor
Two kids believed in fate
I would climb up to your bedroom
While your parents tried to catch you
As we danced the night away

And we were just kids
But we knew it was love
Twenty years old
The whole world against us
A hundred more years
Still wouldn't be enough
Forever in love
It began with a crush

Where you go
I'll go too
It's only life if I'm
Living it with you
I'll always be
By your side
I am yours and
You are mine
In every lifetime

We moved into the lake house
The one from your old hometown
Two kids along the way
We raised them to be lovers
With eyes just like their mother's
That light up their whole face

We taught them to love
Even when their heart breaks
They grew up and soon
Each of them moved away
And they could have kids
Of their own someday
No matter the distance
We loved them the same

Where you go
I'll go too
It's only life if I'm
Living it with you
I'll always be
By your side
I am yours and
You are mine
In every lifetime

I'm so happy that I met you
And you spent your life with me too
Two kids believed in fate
Now even though were older
We love like we were younger
For the rest of our days"

I know that I'll be fine
'Cuz I know Peter Pan was right
Just a lost boy in a small town
I'm the same kid but I'm grown now
Try to make it out
But I don't know how
Wish that I was young
What have I become
Now it's late night and I'm at home
So I make friends with shadow
And I play him all my sad sad songs
And we don't talk
But he sings along like
Oooh
Fairy tales are not the truth
What am I supposed to do
Mmmmmm..
I guess Peter Pan was right
Growing up's a waste of time
So I think I'll fly away
Set a course for brighter days
Find the second star I'm soaring
Then straight on to the morning
I know that I'll be fine
'Cuz I know Peter Pan was right
Days feel like a blur now
Still feel eighteen but I'm burnt out
So I daydream of what I could be
If I turned back time
To a storyline
Where my mom read me a tale where
A couple kids one girl and a sailor
Met a boy in green
I thought it'd be me
But I guess that dream
Wasn't meant to be like
Oooh
Fairy tales are not the truth
What am I supposed to do
Mmmmmm..

Growing up's a waste of time
So I think I'll fly away

If I never land

Always better than
My life right now

To hold onto something
Or let go when my heart tells me to

Baby we crash and we burn
Over and over and over again
The lesson that I have to learn is
It's not love, but
It's still something
It's enough to keep
Me from running from you
Might know it too
But maybe we're afraid of telling the truth 'cause
It's not love, but
It's still something
But, isn't it nice?
How I come alive
When the moon meets your eyes, it's
Not a surprise that we've held on for so long
But, doesn't it hurt?
To get so high and fall down so slowly
What it worth it worth?
When you give your all and you get back nothing?
Maybe we know how it's all gonna end
Baby we crash and we burn
Over and over and over again
The lesson that I have to learn is

연락도 없이 며칠동안 사라졌다가
아무 일도 없었다는 듯
그냥 조금 바빴다며 웃는 건
나를 사랑하지 않으니까요....

둘이 만날 때 자꾸 누굴 부르려 하고
마지못해 대꾸를 하고
딴생각에 마냥 잠겨 있는 건
나를 사랑하지 않으니까요.....

늦은 밤중에 보고 싶다 
전화 와서 달려 나가면
그냥 나의 품에 안겨 한참 울면서
끝내 아무 말이 없다가
참 미안하다고,늘 고맙다는...
그건 어쩌면 나를 사랑하지 않으니까요.....

몇 번씩이나 이유 없이 한숨을 쉬고,
어색하게 웃음을 짓고,
늘 창문 밖을 바라보고 있는 건,
나를 사랑하지 않으니까요.....

싫어졌냐고 좋아하긴 한거냐고 몰아세울 때
그냥 나의 손을 잡고 한참 울면서
끝내 아무 말이 없다가
잘 모르겠다고, 왜 이러는지...
그건 아마도 나를 사랑하지 않으니까요.....
이젠 더 이상 나를 사랑하지 않으니까요....."

Had to give away my heart to get some good luck
Betting all my chips all in
I'll see you when I see you again

Foot on the gas
In a hurry
And I didn't even pack
A little blurry
Tryna hold tears back
I said goodbye to the life we had
I tossed the phone
Friends calling
But I wanna be alone
Bout to listen to 100 sad songs
Bout to listen to 100 sad songs

Look like I swim when I really drown
Voices in my head have been getting loud
Weigh myself down I'm a heavy thinker
See my whole life slipping through my fingers

Is this all a test or is it a guess?
I would never right so that's why I left
They lying straight to your face life ain't getting much sweeter than this

Thinking you would do the same

Is lookin' at the mirror, wish that you were here
Growing up is—

Get emotional at two in the morning
It's a habit, know I shouldn’t be callin’
Then you let me in, is that what you wanted?
Is this what we wanted?
Now you're back in town, no, I can’t come around
Are we better without the what ifs and doubts
Is this it?
Are we both too far gone to forget
And try again?

I still fall in love with you
Every time I see your eyes
It takes me back to the first time
I saw you smile
They told us we were young and dumb
We didn’t know about love
Now look at all the things we’ve become

No I never think about us
사랑한만큼 뜨거웠던 우리 다툼
I wanna know how you feel
별일없이 살고 있길 너와 내
사이에는 감정 빠진 추억만이
제자리에 남아있지
매일같이
울고 불고 했던 기억들
고통 속에 머릴 쥐어뜯고
가끔 보이는 네 사진 속에
웃고있는 얼굴 난 배아픔
No no more
No no more
난 행복한 솔로
그래 이 노래는
너를 멋지게 잊어내고
잘 살고있는 나의 Self made promo
Yea I'm so so proud of myself
Rockin that prada all retail
So so proud of myself
Rockin that prada
All retail
I am sick of a being blue
기대할 거 없는 기다림도
웃고있는 우리 사진 속
이해할 수 없는 감정들도

일하느라 바빠

really can't explain how I'm feeling
I don't wanna live sometimes

Wake up what a night
The perfect night to sink into the floor and die
It's no love but close enough
It's only fun but just because your clothes are off
And oh love I'm mostly numb
I'm lonely 'cause you know you were my only one
You should know I don't love you
Don't think that I don't know
People come and go
But now I feel I'm on the hemisphere alone
Oh love the things you said still echo
On inside my head
Maybe it's just a daydream

Wake up what a night
The perfect night to sink into the floor and die

Her firm embrace it would make my final bed
Mother Nature takes no prisoners
But I'll never leave these living walls
You got me seduced in fluent haiku
I'll be abused if that means
I can lie beside you
Where I'll dissolve
Into the colors on the forest floor
And far above
The butterflies flutter by
But I won't buzz along
To her I came just to lay and rest my head
Her firm embrace
It would take my final breath
But Mother Nature decides
That's why
She'll always rule and you'll abide it
That's what I did too
Just lie to die

And I am lost in the thought
Of how you are today

In an afterglow

And this silly freakin' song
3 am and I really don't mind
If I gotta be your another backseat lover
Baby I've been waiting too long
And I'm writing this song just to tell you
I love you
Saturday night now I'm waitin outside
And I'm ready to take you to my secret heaven
Dreamin so long
So baby please come along
And I wrote this song just to tell you
I love you
3 am and I really don't mind
If I gotta be your another backseat lover
Baby I've been waiting too long
And I'm writing this song just to tell you
I love you
3 am and I really don't mind
If I gotta be your another backseat lover
Baby I've been waiting too long
And I'm writing this song just to tell you
I love you"
1220,OH WELL,Christian French,"Oh, well, everything just went to hell
Might be the worst that I ever felt
Oh well, everything just went to hell
Might be the worst that I ever felt
Oh well, I guess I'll go - myself
The sun still shines while I'm taking L's
Last night I lost my car in K town
My phone died, I barely found my way out
Yeah, my pockets and chest are as empty as it gets
'Cause I lost the girl I used to love
It's not the same now
Guess that things won't go my way
Brush my teeth, gеtting ready for a cold hard day
It's just another day
Oh well, еverything just went to hell
Might be the worst that I ever felt
Oh well, I guess I'll go - myself
The sun still shines while I'm taking L's
Oh, well (oh well)
Oh, well (oh well)
Oh, well
Oh, well (oh well)
Oh, well (oh well)
Oh, well
I'm not living, I'm surviving
Chasing the horizon
Know I'll never get there
I been stuck out on an island
Talking to the silence
'Cause nobody else cares
My label said no more sad songs on the album
(Finger violins)
But I write what I feel and this shit's not about them
So, I say
Oh well, everything just went to hell
Might be the worst that I ever felt
Oh well, I guess I'll go - myself
The sun still shines while I'm taking L's
Oh, well (oh well)
Oh, well (oh well)

It's just another day
Oh well, everything just went to hell

Oh well, I guess I'll go - myself
The sun still shines while I'm taking L's

1222,I'd Rather Be Alone,Brye,"This morning in the shower
I was hit with the revelation
We've been fighting non stop
And we can't keep a conversation
You never see my family
And you don't say I'm pretty anymore
The only time we see each other
Our mouths are stuck together
Like rubber and glue
We stick and bounce right off each other
I don't think that means we love one another
Things have been off
Throw a wineglass at my head
As I walk through the door
Turn a tiny little problem into so much more
We spend hours and hours crying
Over the phone
Is it bad to say I'd rather be alone?
Months and months of sitting 'round
Cause we got nowhere to be
Oh you're such a waste of
My time and energy
Been so high that we couldn't see all the lows
Is it bad to say I'd rather be alone?
We toss and turn
And synchronize our moody swinging
You run in circles waiting for nobody
I take a risk and tell you that I'm unhappy
It backfires
You make me break down
And then I crawl back to ya
And we rehearse our sorrys
With dramatic crying
And then the cycle stars over again
And again and again and again
Throw a wineglass at my head
As I walk through the door
Turn a tiny little problem into so much more
We spend hours and hours crying
Over the phone
Is it bad to say I'd rather be alone?
Months and months of sitting 'round
Cause we got nowhere to be
Oh you're such a waste of
My time and energy
Been so high that we couldn't see all the lows
Is it bad to say I'd rather be alone?
Down again we go
Wasting time cause we don't know
And we're too scared to be alone
But I'm done
Hold on to the highs
I know you don't like goodbyes
But this has to happen
Cause we'd honestly be better off alone
Throw a wineglass at my head
As I walk through the door
(Is it bad to say I'd rather be alone?)
Turn a tiny little problem into so much more
(Is it bad to say I'd rather be alone?)
Months and months of sitting 'round
Cause we got nowhere to be
(Is it bad to say I'd rather be alone?)
Oh you're such a waste of
My time and energy
(Is it bad to say I'd rather be alone?)
You hate my guts and you hate my friends
(Is it bad to say I'd rather be alone?)
I think the only solution is tying up loose ends
(Is it bad to say I'd rather be alone?)
I don't even know how we lasted this long
(Is it bad to say I'd rather be alone?)
I doubt you'll even bother listening
To this song
(Is it bad to say I'd rather be alone?)
Is it bad to say is it bad to say
I'd rather be alone?
Is it bad to say is it bad say
I'd rather be alone?"
1224,Again,Sam Ock(샘 옥),"It's okay
I get up on the wrong side of the bed too
Many times I know I
Don't do what I should do
Even when I know it's good for me
And I don't really have an excuse
But you know
Maybe it is time to try again
Maybe I'm the first to tell you
That your days aren't over yet
I don't want you to forget
Maybe there's another page to this
And maybe you're the perfect fit
Life ain't all that it's caught up to be
All these castles we've built on the beach
And watch them wash away
But there's another day
So don't you pay no mind
To what they're talkin' 'bout
Life will be what you make it to be
Time keeps ticking along to your beat
So this I want to say
Because I know it will be worth it
I think that we should try again
Oh no this is not the end
My friend
Why is living so hard
It's a question I can't keep out of my mind
I throw it out and it comes back
Every time to torment me
I guess that living good ain't quite that easy
I know there's another page to this
And I think you're the perfect fit
Life ain't all that it's caught up to be
All these castles we've built on the beach
And watch them wash away
But there's another day
So don't you pay no mind
To what they're talkin' 'bout
Life will be what you make it to be
Time keeps ticking along to your beat
So this I want to say
Because I know it will be worth it
I think that we should try again
Oh no this is not the end
My friend
Y'all know what time it is
Life ain't all that it's caught up to be
All these castles we've built on the beach
And watch them wash away
But there's another day
Life will be what you make it to be
Time keeps ticking along to your beat
So this I want to say
Because I know it will be worth it
I think that we should try again"

We watch the waves crash
From my living room
But you got over that after a month or two
Sick of the beach so we flew to New York
And we partied all night
But you still say you're bored
We both know something's gotta change
'Cause I'm all give and baby you're all take
You pick another fight tryna find
Another thing wrong with us
I was down to let it slide
'Cause you get a little mean
When you drink too much
Girl can you name a time
I didn't go and get you everything you want?
Nah thought about giving you
One more chance
Never mind let's break up
Never mind let's break up
When you're upset I end up on the couch
And I feel like a stranger inside my own house
I stopped working late
And I stopped getting high
And I stopped being me

Pick another fight tryna find
Another thing wrong with us

1232,Living It Up,Alt Bloom,"Shes in a sunshine state of mind
Wearing a halo to one side
Got a little broken it's alright
Bound to hit your head
when you're learning to fly
In the Saturn with no bills
Feels like it's all been up hill
Cant catch a break nah the heat kills
Rather be rolling then be standing still
Heights that are meant to be
Type in your destiny
Get there eventually
Yea we're gonna find out
What they're talking bout
We'll be living it up
In California
We'll be living it up
How we're s'pose ta
Top down in Hollywood
Girl always looking good
Sun setting from the hood
Let's go
Big coast
We'll be
Living it up
Where partying's a job and lifestyle
Waking up to work hard and get wild
Reaching them stars might take a while
But for now you're still a beautiful sun child
Where you wanna be
Type in the destiny
Get there eventually
Yea we're gonna find out
What they're talking bout
We'll be living it up
In California
We'll be living it up
How we're s'pose ta

 Only thing I believe in...

 The sound of me losing myself

 I've been feeling alone
 I don't know where to go
 I've been looking for home

 Pulling over, you say
 Don't cry and drive
 I've been feeling alone
 I don't know where to go
 Could you stay on the phone
 Could you talk me down
 On the side of the road
 Pulling over now
 Don't cry and drive

 Put my seat back in fight or flight
 Not really sure do I have time?
 To feel this, til I, don't need to anymore
 ""Keep it simple""

1237,Old Boyfriends,Phillip Vo,"I scrolled down your insta page
Saw a picture that I didn't wanna see
He had his hand around your waist
And a smile on your face like the way
You look at me
Cause only eight months ago
He was holding your hand
Slow dancing and kissing the top of your head
And I don't know how to compete with that
'Cause you were friends since you were kids
And still feels like we just only met
Yeah I was so naive
Thinking that you've only felt this way for me
You always tell me
I'm the only one you wanna be with
So why can't I believe it?
Yeah old boyfriends kinda scare me
Cause they all gotta' little bit of history with you
Even when you try to tell me
I got no real reason to worry my
Mind starts to imagine things that
Never happened
I start to believe that you're still in love
With some other has been baby I'm just asking
Do you think I'm gonna be the last one?
The last one?
I've heard stories about exes
Calling up brides on their wedding day
Professing all the love from a once upon a time
That that threw away
And the fear that that
I'm fighting is constantly rising
In the back of my mind
Is that you'll finally open up your eyes
That you'll leave me for another guy
Yeah it's a scary truth
That maybe I don't know you in the way they do
You always tell me
I'm the only one you wanna be with
So why can't I believe it?
Yeah old boyfriends kinda scare me
Cause they all gotta' little bit of history with you

With some other has been baby I'm just asking
Do you think I'm gonna be the last one?
Do you think I'm gonna be the last one?
Baby the hardest part
Is fighting back this anxious heart
But I have come to realize that
If we don't have trust then
We might as well have nothing
But old boyfriends still scare me
They all gotta little bit of history with you
Even when you try to tell me
I got no real reason to worry my
Mind keeps on imagining
Things that I know aren't happening
I start believe that you're still in love
With some other has been baby I'm just asking
Do you think I'm gonna be the last one?
Last one do you think I'm gonna be the last one?"

 So please come hold me darling

 I know you hate living alone 'cause you had a roommate
 Back in college
 I got collages of your pics on my wall
 Wrote these albums about you
 'Cause I'm still trying to process being out of your contact
 I'm so scared of the phone

 We were fifteen
 Naive with our dreams and now I'm thinking of you
 I'm about to be 23, how could it be that I'm still thinking of you

 It's 9 PM on a Friday and I'm still in my room
 Heard you got a house with your guy, out there in Malibu
 Oh, Beverly Hills, heartbreak, it kills when it comes out of the blue
 Emotions were spilled, I'm crying 'cause I'm still in love with you

 So please come hold me darling
 I feel bad I'm calling, but I couldn't wait till the morning
 I know you hate living alone 'cause you had a roommate
 Back in college
 I got collages of your pics on my wall
 Wrote these albums about you
 'Cause I'm still trying to process being out of your contact
 I'm so scared of the phone

 We were fifteen
 Naive with our dreams and now I'm thinking of you
 I'm about to be 23, how could it be that I'm still thinking of you

 It's 9 PM on a Friday and I'm still in my room"

1249,home is lonely,Mitch James(미치 제임스),"I remember being 13
Having my first drink
Throwing up inside the kitchen sink
It was you and I on the same side
Getting high chasing paradise
Now suddenly we're 18
Doing the same thing
Drinking the same drinks
When I look around
No one else is even dying to get out
I held my breath
Took a plane out west
I left to be happy
And now you hold it against me
Tell me how could home be the place
That makes me lonely?
And everyone that knows me
Doesn't know me at all
I didn't think that
Changing would turn my friends to strangers
Is this life worth the chase
If there's nobody to call?
I know we wasn't raised that way
There's certain things you just don't say
When you're supposed to be my best mates
Now I'm alone when I celebrate
We wanted to be astronauts movie stars
Millionaires with fancy cars
I didn't think they'd tear us all apart
Tell me how could home be the place
That makes me lonely?
And everyone that knows me
Doesn't know me at all
I didn't think that
Changing would turn my friends to strangers
Is this life worth the chase
If there's nobody to call?
It fucking kills me to say it
I had to lose you to change me
I feel so lost and I hate it
I had to lose you to change me
Tell me how could home be the place
That makes me lonely?
And everyone that knows me
Doesn't know me at all
I didn't think that
Changing would turn my friends to strangers
Is this life worth the chase
If there's nobody to call?
It fucking kills me to say it
I had to lose you to change me
I feel so lost and I hate it
I had to lose you to change me"

 said you were stuck up

you barely show ‘em cuz your mouth says, 
“haven’t worn my retainer in 300 weeks”
heard that your exes are all obsessed and,
you don’t go out without a book to read
you barely talk unless you’re impressed
and your voice when you sing sounds just like Phoeb’s,
so if you spilled your drink on a brand new couch
well I’d take all of the blame 
and if you broke some vase with a priceless face
I’d offer up to pay
tho realistically I’m broke and 
honestly would prefer that you
 just decide to pay for it yourself...
would you stay with me

if you don’t like to hold hands 
we could never don’t even have to smile 
while we’re together
would you stay with me

if you don’t like to dance then I’ll remember
 don’t even have to be friends for forever
you said I’m runner up for best dressed
got me
blushing so hard that
I forgot to speak
you looked away to just ignore the awkward silence
now I’m pretty damn sure that I’ll be losing sleep
but if you spilled your drink

 on a brand new couch
well I’d take all of the blame
 and if you broke some vase with a priceless face
I’d offer up to pay...
tho seriously I actually am broke 
so if iIoffer pay just say no thanks you’re way 
too sweet and also super attractive...

and we find another house
so we can do it all again
I like you and I don’t like your friends
let’s make out just to say that it’s pretend 
scream and shout till we get kicked out

Wishin' I could take them back

Why am I hold on to loose ends and faded scars?

You let me down slow oh oh
Slow oh oh oh slow oh oh
Me you let me down
Heard you met a guy I'd hate
Seems like he's a guy you'd never date
He's the type you said was fake
Guess it's true that people change
What am I waiting for?
What am I waiting for?
It's been two years and more more
I should've never known
What does he have I don't?
Will he do things I won't?
Why am I holdin' on?

Right from the very start
I felt empty every time
We were apart
Know I'm always in the studio
But I just wanted you to know
I can't wait to come home to you
I hope one day I make it big
Not for the fortune or the fame
Not for the bling
Just so I can go out and buy you everything
Buy you a house and diamond ring

A million songs a day
But still I would have more to say

I promise I'll catch every tear
You ever cry
And hold your hand through all the years
As they go by
Just know I'll always have your back
If you forget just play this track
And know that I'll always belong to you

In the desert you're my rain
You're my sunrise and my sunset

And our lives rearrange
Like they do
The one thing that'll stay the same
Is the I way I feel for you
We can go for a drive in my car
Or just stare at the stars
And the moon
Or we could
Spend the day
Tucked away
In my bed
Just as long as I'm here next to you

그저 내 뒤에 선 너를 볼 때면
괜한 걱정에
망설여지는데

얼마가 걸린대도
분명히 다가갈테니
넌 또 이럴 것 같애
또 저럴 것 같애

우린 잘 어울릴 것 같애
전부 말해줄게 널

I wonder what I'd be up to
Where would I be and with what kind of view
What if there are other me's
Somewhere out in the galaxy
I let myself daydream
'Cause maybe there's some other universe
I'd put it all in reverse
If only I could I would turn back the clock
To before I ever knew you and then
I'd still end up at that same old restaurant
And fall for you all over again
All over again
You and I were magnetized
Connected by the great divine
Tiny electrons always intertwined
And if I had a hundred million lives
With infinitely different storylines
It would be you every time
If only I could I would turn back the clock
To before I ever knew you and then
I'd still end up at that same old restaurant
And fall for you all over again
All over again and again and again
And I've fallen again
Maybe there's some other universe
I'd still go after you first
If only I could I would turn back the clock
To before I was yours and then
I'd (you'd) put on that same white dress
and walk to you (me)
To say yes all over again
I'd fall for you all over again"

How you got me out here feeling used
(Feeling used oh no)
Don't show him those things that I taught you

1286,Mourning,Post Malone(포스트 말론),"Don't want to sober up
The sun is killin' my buzz
That's why they call it 'mourning'
Thought I was strong enough
Threw my bottle at the sky said
'God that's a warning'
Don't wanna sober up
Try to keep it inside but I just wanna pour it
Thought I was strong enough
Got a lot of shit to say
Couldn't fit it in the chorus
I just left Wally spent a Maserati
The way I gotta flex you think I did Pilates
I call my quote unquote friends
'Do you got plans?'
Turns out everyone's free when the dinner is
Then they drag me to a party out in Malibu
After thirty High Noons it was pretty cool
Tried to shoot my shot
She told me that she had to shoot
Bye bye (Damn)
Don't want to sober up
The sun is killin' my buzz
That's why they call it 'mourning'

Got a lot of shit to say
Couldn't fit it in the chorus
Stumblin' down the corridor
Came across an open door
Throwin' up is easy
And who put on The Commodores?
That's a nice tile floor
Wish I got to know you more
Who am I talkin' to? Nobody
Take me outside I'm a little too high
Paid a little too much for the time of my life
When the money ain't a problem
Everyone's lying
Even when I tell myself that i

Now I'm tying us together
Tell myself I wouldn't feel things
If I labeled us whatever
But the way you put your clothes on
While you're dancing in the mirror
Got me thinking it's been so long
Since I felt so fucking unwell
I've been losing sleep, I can't eat
I'm so weak, oh-oh, oh-oh (oh-oh, oh-oh)
I wasn't looking for this
Now I don't want this to end

You're the kind of medication (medication)
Like it's taken off the shelf
Giving me these complications (complications)

Gonna need it
Dance in the dark
If you feel it
Just trying to start a conversation with you
Maybe for once get the courage
Known you for months, still make me nervous
What's holding me back? I got nothing to lose

Well I hope you don't look at me as a friend
But I love it when you look at me like that

So can I kiss you yet?
Picture the moment inside my head
Playing it out like a vhs
Over and over again
So can I kiss you yet?
Throw myself to the bottom
And once we start there ain't no stopping
Let's go all night
So can I kiss you over and over?
Again, again, again, again, again, again, again
Over again, over again

Just like I thought, like no other
Hands on your skin melt like butter
Can't get enough and I love the way that you taste
Now that you're my piece of heaven
Still want you bad, more than ever
When I'm alone I'm impatiently waiting

So hurry up, hurry up, come back
'Cause I love it when you look at me like that

So can I kiss you yet?
Picture the moment inside my head
Playing it out like a vhs
Over and over again
So can I kiss you yet?
Throw myself to the bottom
And once we start there ain't no stopping
Let's go all night
So can I kiss you over and over?
Again, again, again, again, again, again, again
Over again, over again

Sometimes, sometimes I don't know why we're fighting
You're probably right and I apologize
Want it to be over, have I ever told ya
That I love it when you look at me like that?
So can I kiss you yet?
Picture the moment inside my head
Playing it out like a vhs
Over and over again
So can I kiss you yet?
Throw myself to the bottom
And once we start there ain't no stopping
Let's go all night
So can I kiss you, kiss you?

So can I kiss you yet?
Picture the moment inside my head
Playing it out like a vhs
Over and over again
So can I kiss you yet?
Throw myself to the bottom

 I know you've got friends in the bathroom stall
 Been wanna do this since I met you
 Can we just stay here for one more song

 You'll just get distracted and see someone you know
 I'll be waiting getting impatient all alone
 Go out on the balcony, light myself a smoke
 Start talking to someone that I don't even know
 They just might invite me to see another spot
 You'll be trying to find me again but I'll be gone
 We'll forget each other, the night will carry on
 But that don't have to happen
 And that's not what I want, cos

 I know you can't stay here forever
 I know you've got friends in the bathroom stall
 Been wanna do this since I met you
 Can we just stay here for one more song
 If you leave now might forget you
 The memory fades when I'm way too gone
 Was hoping we'd wake up together
 Maybe just stay here for one more song
 Maybe just stay here for one more song

 Now imagine that you stay and we just keep it going
 Just another couple minutes in the vibe we're on
 Then I'll come with you where you're going and we'll both take one
 Feeling rushing over both of us

 So we'll go out on the balcony
 Light ourselves a smoke
 Start talking to people that we don't even know
 Maybe call a taxi, to hit another spot
 But this time you'll be with me, and yeah that's what I want, cos

 I know you can't stay here forever
 I know you got friends in the bathroom stall
 Been wanna do this since I met you
 Can we just stay here for one more song
 If you leave now might forget you

마음은 더 바빠
나의 시간은 어떤 곳에 있을까
나를 바라보는 시선은
어떻게 보일까
고단한 어둠 끝은 있을까

우연을 닮은 운명 같은 걸 만나
우린 언젠가 빛이 날 거야
이름이 없는 저 별자리라도
빛들을 엮어 이름을 지어줄래
습하고 더운 길 끝에도
꽃은 또 필 거야
시원한 비들이 꼭 내릴 때쯤에
저기 언덕 넘어 어딘가
몰랐었던 길로
어딘가로 이어져 만나듯
거기서 만나
우연을 닮은 운명 같은 걸 만나

치워도 방은 다시 더러워지는거 처럼

나와 너 사이 다시 보단
정리란 말이 당연해질때쯤
생각이 안날 때쯤
기다려보란 친구의 말이 희미해질때쯤
이 밤도 널 지워내겠지라는 생각으로
나는 또 대충 견뎌 내는중 니가 없는 하루를
시간이 약이라면
I overdosed so bad you shouldnt
Have left me at least when we
Were shattered
마지막을 거짓말로 믿는
내가 정말로 나쁘다면 또 다른 방법
하나 둘 찾다보면 maybe ill forget how it goes
Sing singing along to the songs that
We used to know
Another day another more
And ill forget how it goes

그날에 난 그 밤에 널 그려본다
단지 외로워서 널 꺼내본거야
다시 돌아갈수 없단걸 알면서
널 생각해본거야
흘러가 날 떠난버린 널
놓치고 싶지 않은 이별로 남겨둘테니까

That messed up tape deck's still stuck playin' that mix I made for you
Yeah, that's my strawberry wine stain
My nail polish on the tailgate
So much of me left, I bet, you must get déja vu

When you're runnin' around in that stick shift Chevy, I bet it drives you crazy
Thinkin' about us on every other back road, baby
You got someone new on your bench seat, tryin' to forget me lately
But my memory's stuck, so good luck
Tryna get me out of that truck

So go on, touch that paint up where I scratched the driver's side
That won't take back all our weekend for no reason rides

Will always be mine in your head

I'm the one you're thinking 'bout
My Silverado silhouette
Still shotgun riding in your head

1362,Save Me The Trouble,Dan & Shay(댄 & 셰이),"I can tell by the way that you're stirrin' your drink
Oh, we're already playin' with fire
Said that you had to go 'bout an hour ago
Baby, you're such a beautiful liar

It feels like a movie I've already seen
So right now I'm beggin' you, please

Why don't you save me the trouble
Keep those pretty blue eyes to yourself
Why don't you save me the trouble
Give that heartache to somebody else
If you're the kinda girl that's only gonna wanna love and leave
A guy like me alone in this bar drinkin' double
Why don't you save me the trouble, save me the trouble baby

Now the closer I get to the red on your lips
I can feel myself fallin' all crazy
'Cause just a little kiss and I could never get you out of my mind
So before you go wreck my whole life


Why don't you save me the trouble
Keep those pretty blue eyes to yourself
Why don't you save me the trouble (Save me the trouble, baby)
Give that heartache to somebody else (Somebody else)

1363,IF YOU GO DOWN (I'M GOIN' DOWN TOO),Kelsea Ballerini,"I've known you since Brad and Angelina
We go back like Pontiac seats
If I got an aisle with a mess I gotta clean up
I know you'll be showin' up with bleach

All those names that we don't ever speak of
Got a couple nights that have slipped my mind
Proof and photographs have been deleted
If you ever needed an alibi

'Cause dirt on you is dirt on me
And we both know our hands ain't clean
If it all blows up and we end up on the news
If you go down, I'm goin' down too

It's a good thing we're each other's kinda crazy
Ain't no judgment or keepin' score
If you rob a bank, I'm your getaway Mercedes
God knows that's what friends are for

'Cause dirt on you is dirt on me
And we both know our hands ain't clean
If it all blows up and we end up on the news
If you go down, I'm goin' down too
If you do down, I'm goin' down too, yeah

I keep all your secrets by the dozen
You know where my skeletons sleep
Hypothetically, if you ever kill your husband
Hand on the Bible, I'd be lyin' through my teeth

'Cause dirt on you is dirt on me
And we both know our hands ain't clean
If it all blows up and we end up on the news
If you go down, I'm goin' down too
Our bodies are buried and they're in the same ditch
So even if I wanted to, I can't snitch
Thirty to life would go quicker with you, yeah
So if you go down, I'm goin' down too
If you go down, I'm goin' down too
If you go down, I'm goin' down too"
1367,But I Got A Beer In My Hand,Luke Bryan(루크 브라이언),"Yeah
Yeah

That old familiar, meant to kill you, middle finger, rearview mirror
Supposed to make a country boy sad
I should be in my recliner, whiskey typin' up one-liners
Cryin', trying to get you back
Yeah, I know how that country song goes
I'm supposed to be heartbroke

But I got a beer in my hand, and I got it raised up high
I ain't got a give in my damn right, I can do this all night
Country done came to town, this town don't stand a chance
I'll holler at the ladies, dancin' like crazy, new Luccheses, fresh up out the deer stand
Feelin' this high, wasn't part of my plan
Wasn't even gonna try
But I got a beer in my hand

The bands playin' David Lee Murphy, party crowd, it's party thirty
Lawdy mercy, I'm feelin' good
And I'm bettin' you're bettin', that I'm a wreck and you reckon
I'll call you up any second and I would

But I got a beer in my hand, and I got it raised up high

I meant to miss you
Oops, my bad
I meant to be blue

But I got a beer in my hand, and I got it raised up high

1368,Angels (Don’t Always Have Wings),Thomas Rhett(토마스 레트),"I don't talk to God like you always tell me I should
I don't live my life every day like you prayed that I would
Yeah, I'm a mess of a man, with lessons to learn
You're the last thing on earth I deserve

You shoulda slammed the door
Changed the lock and said adios
To my selfish heart, tore it apart and left me alone
Don't know why you were patient and wasted good savin' on me
Maybe angels don't always have wings

I ain't that type of guy that miracles wake up next to
For too long, I didn't know what I had but, dang, these days I do
If I make it to heaven, it'll be by a hair
But one look at you and I'm back

You shoulda slammed the door
Changed the lock and said adios
To my selfish heart, tore it apart and left me alone
Don't know why you were patient and wasted good savin' on me
Maybe angels don't always have...

Wings and halos
But hey, what do I know?
'Cause I damn near drug one through hell

But you shoulda slammed the door
Changed the lock and said adios
To my selfish heart, tore it apart and left me alone
Don't know why you were patient and wasted good savin' on me
Whoa, whoa
Now I believe, that maybe angels don't always have wings

Oh
They don't always have wings"
1371,Religiously,Bailey Zimmerman,"I went looking at pictures I didn't wanna see, they brought back memories
You look happy, I guess, got the life that you wanted but it ain't with me
You would think by now that I wouldn't care, it's been a couple years and yeah, I've had my share
Of other broken up hearts but I only shed real tears over ours

Now I'm in this cold bright light
And this don't even feel like life
'Cause I don't have the only woman who believed in me
Religiously (Religiously)
And now I'm in the back of the church
Praying just to stop the hurt
'Cause I don't have the only woman who was there for me
Religiously (Religiously)

Remember watchin' you play me our song on guitar, I thought I'd marry you
Act like I'm happier now but all of my friends know that ain't the truth
And lately life's been good to me
Momma's healthy and I'm helpin' out the whole family
A lot of people know my name, I made a little change
But that don't mean nothin'

'Cause now I'm in this cold bright light
And this don't even feel like life
'Cause I don't have the only woman who believed in me
Religiously (Religiously)
And now I'm in the back of the church
Praying hard just to stop the hurt
'Cause I don't have the only woman who was there for me
Religiously (Religiously)

You brought me to God and I put you through Hell
You were all about us, I was all about myself
What kind of man would lose a woman like that?
If my soul could be forgiven, I would give it all back

Now I'm in this cold bright light
And this don't even feel like life
'Cause I don't have the only woman who believed in me
Religiously
And now I'm in the back of the church
Begging God just to stop the hurt
'Cause I don't have the only woman who believed in me
Religiously (Religiously)
I ain't got the only woman who was there for me

1372,Fast Car,Luke Combs,"You got a fast car
And I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Startin' from zero got nothin' to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me myself I got nothin' to prove
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been workin' at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city
And you and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it means to be livin'
See my old man's got a problem
He live in the bottle that's the way it is
He said his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
So Mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said 'somebody's gotta take care of him'
So I quit school and that's what I did
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Still gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way
So I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped
Around my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone
Be someone be someone
You got a fast car
We go cruising entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
So I work in the market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
And we'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house live in the suburbs
So I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped
Around my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone
Be someone be someone
You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together
You and me would find it
I got no plans I ain't goin' nowhere
Take your fast car and keep on driving
So I remember when we were driving
Driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped
Around my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone
Be someone be someone
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Still gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way"
1373,Last Night,Morgan Wallen,"Last night we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But baby, baby, somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night

I kiss your lips
Make you grip the sheets with your fingertips
Last bottle of Jack we split a fifth
Just talk about life goin' sip for sip
Yeah, you, you know you love to fight
And I say shit I don't mean
But I'm still gon' wake up wantin' you and me

I know that last night we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But baby, baby somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night
No way it was our last night

No way it was the last night that we break up
I see your tail lights in the dust
You call your momma, I call your bluff
In the middle of the night, pull it right back up
Yeah, my, my friends say let her go
Your friends say what the hell
I wouldn't trade your kind of love for nothin' else

Oh baby, last night we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said but we said it all
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But baby, baby, somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet

No way it was our last night, we said we'd had enough
I can't remember everything we said but we said too much
I know you packed your shit and slammed the door right before you left
But baby, baby, somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night
No way it was our last night

I know you said this time you really weren't coming back again
But baby, baby, somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night

1375,You Should Be Here,Cole Swindell(콜 스윈델),"It's perfect outside
It's like God let me dial up the weather

Better stop and take it in kinda scenes
Everything's just right
Yeah except for one thing
 
You should be here
Standing with your arm around me here
Cutting up, cracking a cold beer saying cheers
Hey y'all it's sure been a good year
It's one of those moments
That's got your name written all over it
And you know that if I had just one wish
It'd be that you didn't have to miss this
You should be here
 
You'd be taking way too many pictures on your phone
Showing them off to everybody that you know back home
And even some you don't yeah
They say now you're in a better place
And I would be too if I could see your face
 
You should be here
Standing with your arm around me here

You'd be loving this
You'd be freaking out,
You'd be smiling, yeah
I know you'd be all about 
What's going on right here right now
God I wish somehow you could be here

Oh you should be here

1376,I'm Comin' Over,Chris Young(크리스 영),"We say ""goodbye, see you around""
We turn our backs then turn back around
We break up, we make up, and we make love
We can't seem to let go, girl

So I'm comin' over, runnin' every red light
To hell with the closure save it for another time
Try not to think about you, but it ain't workin'
Why put out a fire when it's still burnin'
Just when I think movin' on is getting closer
I'm comin' over

I'm all alone, but you're on my phone
Tellin' me you miss me and that you're at home
Who knows what we are in the morning
All I know is I want you

So I'm comin' over, runnin' every red light
To hell with the closure save it for another time
Try not to think about you, but it ain't workin'
Why put out a fire when it's still burnin'
Just when I think movin' on is getting closer
I'm comin' over

Ooooh, I'm comin' over

Yeah, we said that we're done and I know that it's late
But you already know I'm on my way

I'm comin' over, runnin' every red light
To hell with the closure save it for another time

1379,Check Yes Or No,George Strait(조지 스트레이트),"It started way back in third grade.
I used to sit beside Emmylou Hayes
A pink dress, a matching bow, and her pony tail.
She kissed me on the school bus, but told me not to tell
Next day I chased her round the playground
Across the monkey bars, to the merry-go-round
And Emmylou got caught passing me a note
Before the teacher took it, I read what she wrote.

Do you love me, do you wanna be my friend?
And if you do, well then don't be afraid
to take me by the hand If you want to.
I think this is how love goes, check yes or no.

Now we're grown up and she's my wife.
Still like two kids with stars in our eyes.
Ain't much changed, I still chase Emmaylou
Up and down the hall, around the bed in our room.
Last night I took her out in a white limousine
Twenty years together, she still gets to me
Can't believe it's been that long ago.
When we got started with just a little note.

Do you love me, do you wanna be my friend?
And if you do, well then don't be afraid
to take me by the hand If you want to.
I think this is how love goes, check yes or no.

Do you love me, do you wanna be my friend?
And if you do, well then don't be afraid to
take me by the hand If you want to.
I think this is how love goes, check yes or no."

아쉽지만 이제는 안녕
행복했어 너도 그랬길 바라
마지막 인사 웃는 게 예뻐
영원의 상자에 다정한 기억만
가득 담았으니 변할 건 없으니
고마웠어 웃으며 또 봐
물기 어린 얼굴로 한달음에 달려와
품 안을 가득 채워주던 순간들
긴 꿈인 것처럼 내 삶에 가장 푸르렀던
모든 날들아
아쉽지만 이제는 안녕
행복했어 너도 그랬길 바라
마지막 인사 웃는 게 예뻐
영원의 상자에 다정한 기억만
가득 담았으니 변할 건 없으니
고마웠어 웃으며 또 봐
그리워져 벌써 그런 기분이야
모든 내일에 행운을 빌어
지나온 길들에 사랑한 흔적만
여기 머물 테니 이어져 있으니
작별 없이 웃으며 또 봐"

Running from a world made up of nine to fives

Would always be in first place

I thought happiness was hard to find
That I could never love my life

And I'll put my hands over your eyes, but you'll peep through

And there'll be sun sun sun all over our bodies
And sun sun sun all down our necks
And sun sun sun all over our faces
And sun sun sun -so what the heck!

Cos I'll be laughing at all your silly little jokes
And we'll be laughing about how we used to smoke
All those stupid little cigarettes and drink stupid wine
Cos it's what we needed to have a good time

And it was fun fun fun when we were drinking
It was fun fun fun when we were drunk
And it was fun fun fun when we were laughing
It was fun fun fun, oh it was fun

Oh well I look at you and say
It's the happiest that I've ever been
And I'll say I no longer feel I have to be James Dean
And she'll say
""Yah well I feel all pretty happy too""
And I'm always pretty happy when I'm just kicking back with you

And it'll be love love love all through our bodies
And love love love all through our minds
And it be Love love love all over her face
And Love love love all over mine

Although maybe all these moments are just in my head
I'll be thinking ‘bout them as I'm lying in bed
And all that I believe, it might not even come true
But in my mind I'm havin' a pretty good time with you

In five years time I might not know you
In five years time we might not speak
In five years time we might not get along
In five years time you might just prove me wrong

Oh there'll be love love love
Wherever you go
There'll be love"
1425,Lucky (feat. Colbie Caillat),Jason Mraz(제이슨 므라즈),"Do you hear me,
I'm talking to you
Across the water across the deep blue ocean
Under the open sky, oh my, baby I'm trying
Boy I hear you in my dreams
I feel your whisper across the sea
I keep you with me in my heart
You make it easier when life gets hard
I'm lucky I'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again
Ooohh ooooh oooh oooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
They don't know how long it takes
Waiting for a love like this
Every time we say goodbye
I wish we had one more kiss
I'll wait for you I promise you, I will
I'm lucky I'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again
Lucky we're in love every way
Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed
Lucky to be coming home someday
And so I'm sailing through the sea
To an island where we'll meet
You'll hear the music fill the air
I'll put a flower in your hair
Though the breezes through the trees
Move so pretty you're all I see
As the world keeps spinning round
You hold me right here right now
I'm lucky I'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been where I have been
Lucky to be coming home again
Lucky we're in love in every way
Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed
Lucky to be coming home someday

Harder than I hurt you

1429,Destiny,Jim Brickman(짐 브릭만),"What if I never knew
What if I never found you
I'd never have this feeling in my heart
How did this come to be 
I don't know how you found me 
But from the moment I saw you
Deep inside my heart I knew

Chorus:
Baby you're my destiny
You and I were meant to be
With all my heart and soul
I give my love to have and hold
And as far as I can see
You were always meant to be my destiny

I wanted someone like you
Someone that I could hold on to
And give my love until the end of time
But forever was just a word
Something I'd only heard about

But now you're always there for me
When you say forever I believe

(chorus)

Maybe all we need is just a little faith
'Cause baby I believe that love will find the way

(instrumental bridge)

Baby you're my destiny
You and I were meant to be
With all my heart and soul
I give my love to have and hold
And as I far as I can see
From now until eternity
You were always meant to be my destiny"

All I wanted to say
And now it's too late to hold you
'Cause you've flown away
So far away

Never had I imagined
Living without your smile
Feeling and knowing you hear me
It keeps me alive, alive

And I know you're shining down
on me from Heaven
Like so many friends
we've lost along the way
And I know eventually
we'll be together
One sweet day

Darling, I never showed you
Assumed you'd always be there
I took your presence for granted
But I always cared
And I miss the love we shared

And I know you're shining down
on me from Heaven
Like so many friends
we've lost along the way
And I know eventually
we'll be together
One sweet day

Although the sun will
never shine the same
I'll always look to a brighter day
Lord I know
when I lay me down to sleep
You will always listen as I pray

And I know you're shining down
on me from Heaven
Like so many friends
we've lost along the way
And I know eventually
we'll be together
One sweet day

And I know you're shining down
on me from Heaven
Like so many friends
we've lost along the way
And I know eventually
we'll be together
One sweet day

Sorry I never told you
All I wanted to say"

And the cares that hung
Around me through the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together
Dancing cheek to cheek
Oh I'd love to climb a mountain
And reach the highest peak
But it doesn't thrill me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
Oh I'd love to go out fishing
In a river or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
Now mama dance with me
I want my arms about you
The charms about you
Will carry me through yes

Around me through the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together

And reach the highest peak
But it doesn't thrill me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
Oh I love to go out fishing
In a river or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
Come on and dance with me
I want my arm about you
The charm about you
Will carry me through to

1432,Way Back Into Love,Hugh Grant(휴 그랜트),"I've been living with a shadow overhead
I've been sleeping
With a cloud above my bed
I've been lonely for so long
Trapped in the past
I just can't seem to move on
I've been hiding all
My hopes and dreams away
Just in case I ever
Need em again someday
I've been setting aside time
To clear a little space
In the corners of my mind
All I want to do is
Find a way back into love
I can't make it
Through without a way back into love
Oh oh oh
I've been watching
But the stars refuse to shine
I've been searching but
I just don't see the signs
I know that it's out there
There's got to be
Something for my soul somewhere
I've been looking for
Someone to shed some light
Not just somebody
Just to get me throught the night
I could use some direction
And I'm open to your suggestions
All I want to do is
Find a way back into love
I can't make it
Through without a way back into love
And if I open my heart again
I guess I'm hoping
You'll be there for me in the end
There are moments
When I don't know if it's real
Or if anybody feels the way I feel
I need inspiration
Not just another negotiation
All I want to do is
Find a way back into love
I can't make it
Through without a way back into love
And if I open my heart to you
I'm hoping you'll show me what to do
And if you help me to start again
You know that
I'll be there for you in the end"
1433,A Lovely Night,Ryan Gosling(라이언 고즐링),"The sun is nearly gone
No lights are turning on
A silver shine that stretches to the sea
We stumble on a view
That's tailor made for two
What a shame those two are you and me
Some other girl and guy
would love this swirling sky
But there's only you and I
And we've got, no shot
This could never be
You're not the type for me
Really?
And there's not a spark in sight
What a, a waste of a lovely night
You say there's nothing here
Well let's make something clear
I think I'll be the one to make that call
what's your call
I know you looked so cute
In your polyester suit
It's wool
You're right I'd never fall for you at all
And maybe this appeals
To someone not in heels
Or to any girl who feels
There's some chance
For romance
But, I'm frankly feeling nothing
Is that so?
Or it could be less than nothing
Good to know
So you agree?
That's right
What a waste of a lovely night"

And now our shades become shadows in your light
In the morning wind we're 
through and tomorrow rescues you,
I will say goodnight

Secret fascination, whisper a quiet tune
Hear me callin' you, Virginia Moon, 
I'll wait for you tonight

And now our shades become shadows in your light
In the morning wind we're 
through and tomorrow rescues you,
I will say goodnight

1437,Heavy,Linkin Park(린킨 파크),"I don't like my mind right now
Stacking up problems that are so unnecessary
Wish that I could slow things down
I wanna let go but there's comfort in the panic
And I drive myself crazy
Thinking everything's about me
Yeah I drive myself crazy
Cause I can't escape the gravity

I'm holding on
Why is everything so heavy
Holding on
So much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy
 
You say that I'm paranoid
But I'm pretty sure the world is out to get me
It's not like I make the choice
To let my mind stay so fucking messy
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning round me just the same
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning round me just the same

I'm holding on
Why is everything so heavy
Holding on
So much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy

I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning round me just the same
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning round me just the same
And I drive myself crazy
Thinking everything's about me
 
I'm holding on
Why is everything so heavy
Holding on

Carelessly killed,
I won't go back to hate.
Back in the past,
I'd see red in my eyes,
I'd never forget or forgave
But how do we love ourselves,
If we're tearing each other down.
How do we love somebody else,
If the cost is the pain of yourself?
Oooh
If only a few,
hear the message I sing,
At least I still played my part.
Cause what is the point,
Of being a star,
If you can't even guide someone home.
But how do we love ourselves,
If we're tearing each other down.
How do I love someone else,
If the cost is the pain of myself?"

Closing in around you

How'd I let you leave like that?
Know you’re never coming back
cuz Only a fool could let you go
Let you go, oh, oh, oh-oh
If I could turn back time
I'd hold your hand mine
Only a fool could let you go
And now I'm a fool alone

Please, take away the pain
'Cause when I hear your name
I miss everything about you
Like the sound of your voice at the end of my phone
Say, ""I need you, I want you, I'm all alone""
No, it's not the same without you, ooh


How'd I let you leave like that? (Like that)

'Cause every time I'm too scared to say
I still think about you all the time
We were never perfect at saying goodbye
But for the last time

Am I waiting on nothing
Or can we try again?
If our problem's worth solving
Then why'd you leave me for dead?
Make a decision on something
Or get out of my bed
If I'm waiting on nothing, mmh
I try to finally forget
What I'm waiting on

Tell me why I needed a moment
Just tell a lie and say that you've changed
I'm so glad you want me in your life
My heart doesn't want to listen to my mind
So for the last time

Am I waiting on nothing
Or can we try again?
If our problem's worth solving
Then why'd you leave me for dead?
Make a decision on something
Or get out of my bed
If I'm waiting on nothing, mmh
I try to finally forget
What I'm waiting on

I'll be alright someday, I know
Got so much life left in me
I can't wait for nothing, and nothing at all
Sunlight hits my face and I know
I'll be alright someday, I know
Got so much life left in me
I can't wait for nothing, and nothing at all

You're the truest thing in this town
And I want you now
Shadows from the streetlight shades
Watching every word you say
Never seen you look that way
And I want you now
Mmm
Nothing more than that
Tried to _ close your eyes
Listened like you almost died
All your love in an old record pile
And I want you now
Spinning like a turning wheel
Looking life the way I feel
You can keep all that you steal
Cause I want you now

Now you act like I don't exist
You wouldn't think that we could go on like this
For much longer

Tell me what do you think of it
Cause right now you seem sick of this
It's not so hard to spot the difference
In the air when I'm not there

Good things come and go
That's why you keep going
Try to keep you close
You make it look so

Easy like the words I speak
Just fall in silence
I've made peace with knowing that
There's no more use in trying
So I guess

Good things come and go
That's why you keep going
Good things come and go

I've been hoping you could see through the noise
That I could hear it in the sound of your voice
But you've been gone and not givin' me a choice
Way too often

I know it's hard breaking habits
But please don't waste what we have yet
Don't say you've lost what you haven't
Cause I'm right here

Good things come and go
That's why you keep goin'
Try to keep you close
You make it look so

Easy like the words I speak
Just fall in silence

There's no more use in trying

That's why you keep going

One too many times like twenty times this week
And I'm standing on two feet
But only barely, it's kinda scary
Knowing you just might decide to try to leave

Knows how to open up
It looks so easy on TV
But when it comes to us

How am I supposed to love you?
When I just can't see
Miss all the way that you said that you'd do
When you look at me
We'll run in cirlces, around my heart
'Cause I'm not ready the way you are
So, ham I supposed to love you
Mm-hmm, mm, if I can't love me?

Little things you do
You left me flowers on the counter
With a note that read, ""I'm such a mess for you""
If you like such a fool
'Cause I sure want you, I really want to
But I'm paralyzed, I'm tryna hide the truth

'Cause everyone except for me
Knows how to open up

 Sometimes all that it takes
 Is one little taste
 Watch the snow melt away
 As the winter changes lanes
 Sunny days, I don't feel so alone
 Sunny days, sunny days in the cold

 City girls in summer clothes are coming out again
 I want to soak it up before it's gone
 And find someone to hold until the next one comes along

No Cap No Cry 이미 죽은 사람 아냐
No Pain No Fail 음악 없는 세상
Nowhere No Fear 바다 같은 색깔
No Cap No Cry 이미 죽은 사람 아냐 사실"
