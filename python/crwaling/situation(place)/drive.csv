What's the use of truth if you doubt it
The sun falls the moon rises
That's how it goes and then again and again
Am I a fool who walks alone talking to myself?
I know it seems ridiculous
I see the ricochet of attention off my ego
But I gotta move on
Sick of getting calls
Hate to be the next one
Cause I have my own
So take your time but don't take mine
I've always been a loner on my journey
And I'll never ever be the second
All the wheels burst and my feet are burning
But I'm still looking ahead
Oh I don't want your sympathyand
I don't need your help at all
Cause I have my own way to go
Keep you out of my way
Smiling out of nowhere
Barely hearing the noise you've never made
Used to see when he comes and goes
Used to be here all alone
Maybe I overstayed
Let me out of your way
Every time I told myself
Don't be (A) fool for love Let me be your lover stay
But what we had wasn't real thing
I've always been a loner on my journey
And I'll never ever be the second
All the wheels burst and my feet are burning

Oh I don't want your sympathy
And I don't need your help at all
Cause I have my own way to go"

I will fight for the light
That sometimes don't shine
Nothing will last

Because I'll hold on till I could
Maybe you'll loose the one so dear
Who kept you warm and safe
I guess even love has it's own ways
It comes and decays
How small are we
When everything changes so helplessly

Like the days gone too far for us to seize
It's like walking through the sky
Where the stars come and go
It's the light within my reach
Not as distant as it seemed
Dreams are moments night is long
And we linger in the past
Tell me do you feel the same
I can take you far far away
Far enough for us to disappear
Should you feel a little scared
Know that I'm still right here
It will be a little bittersweet
It might even feel a bit surreal
Just see the stars run past you as you
Drift apart in air
Like the leaves riding on the autumn breeze
Like the days gone too far for us to seize
We move on and leave it as it is
But once in a while
Let the reminiscence brighten this melody
I can take you far far away
Far enough for us to disappear

사랑이라는 말
어쩌면 순간의 감정의 나열
조건이 붙지 나는 무얼 사랑하는가
충분히 사랑받지 못한 아이
그래서 무엇보다 신중한 타입
나는 말야 원해 진중한 사이
알잖아 영원은 모래성
잔잔한 파도에도 힘없이 쉽게 무너져
상실은 무엇 때문에 슬픈 걸까
사실은 두려운 게 슬픈 거야

So far away, you're gone
Getting far away
Too far away, you're gone
I know I have to know

So time is yet now 
Right here to go
I know you know

So time is yet now

당신은 무엇 땜에 슬픈 걸까
사실은 두려움이 큰 거잖아
함께 미래를 그리던 우리는 없고 
쌓은 모래성들을 
부숴 버린 것은 우린 거야
승패가 없는 게임이라지만 
난 언제나 game loser
모든 걸 주겠다던 우린 모든 것을 부셔
그리고 떠나지 사랑이든 사람이든
모두가 이기적이기 때문이야

So far away, you're gone

떠가는 사람 떠가는 사랑
사랑의 끝은 과연 무엇일까
수많은 사람 스쳐간 사랑
사랑은 사랑으로 완벽할까
그래 말야 이타적인 게 어쩌면 되려 이기적이네
널 위해 한다는 말은 곧 내 욕심이기에
욕심을 버리면 행복해질 건가
채우지 못한 반쪽짜리 허상

삶은 저항과 복종 사이의 싸움이라는데
내가 보기에는 외로움들과의 싸움이네
눈물이 터져 나오면 그대 울어도 돼 (울어도 돼)
당신은 사랑받기에도 이미 충분한데

Anything does know

너가 원하던 게 이제 다 있는데
이 내용마저 클리셰야
질척거리는 게 나는 취향인가 봐
다 지나고 아픈 거 이게 후회인가 봐
그냥 접어서 넣어 전부 상자에다가
나중에 시간 되면 한 번씩 꺼내봐
거리에서 내 노래가 나와
배낭 메고 여행이나 갈까
지나고 보니 시간은 참 빨라
어떻게 너가 다른 남자를 만나
거리에서 내 노래가 나와
텅 빈 가슴을 채웠었지 야망으로 (야망으로)
어떻게 너가 다른 남자를 만나
여전히 거기 있을 텐데
못 지운 사진이 수백 개
지우려고 하면 지우려 할수록
이쁜 것도 전부 구겨질 텐데
그 XX보다 내가 못한 게 뭐야
나는 밤새 너를 지켰지 All night long
다시 와주길 바란 소파
너 빼곤 그대로 있어 정말로
빛이 쏟아 내리던 날
너는 나의 손을 잡았고
영원할 것처럼 말한
Let's just stay one more night
말뿐이었잖아
Black rose in my heart
변해버린 너와 나
With my broken heart
질척거리지 않을게 다시 돌아와
다 끝났어 아프고 너도 후회하잖아
지난 추억들을 꺼내볼까 너와 나
이 노래들 전부 다 너의 얘기잖아
거리에서 내 노래가 나와
배낭 메고 여행이나 갈까
지나고 보니 시간은 참 빨라
어떻게 너가 다른 남자를 만나
거리에서 내 노래가 나와
텅 빈 가슴을 채웠었지 야망으로 (야망으로)
어떻게 너가 다른 남자를 만나
거리에서 내 노래가 나와
배낭 메고 여행이나 갈까
지나고 보니 시간은 참 빨라
어떻게 너가"

너의 노래가 들리면
잊었던 기억이 떠올라

그게 나의 하루인 걸

여전히 그래
하고 싶은 말
참고 담아두는 예전 너의 버릇은
아닌 척해도 늘 티가 나는 걸
맘속에 쌓인 그리움이 널 그리고 있어

And drove out with one finger in the air
Oh, yeah

Sometimes its white
Sometimes she's wrong
Sometimes I'm right
Sometimes we talk about it

But then she'll just change her mind
Sometimes she's hot
Sometimes I'm cold
Sometimes my head wants to explode
But when I think about it
I'm so in love with her
Every other time

Sometimes we sit around
Just the two of us on the park bench
Sometimes we swim around 
Like the dolphins in the ocean of our hearts
But then I think about the time 
When we broke up before the prom 
And you told everyone that I was gay, OK
Sometimes I walk around the town 
For hours just to settle down
But I take you back and you kick me down

No matter what
I'm there for you
Never giving up
I'm there for you
For You

Someone's changed me
Something's saved me
And this is who I am
Although I was blinded
My heart let me find out
That truth makes a better man
I didn't notice
That you were right in front of me
Our masks of silence
We'll put away so we can see

I'm there for you
No matter what
I'm there for you
Never giving up
I'm there for you

You are the light that shines a way
In this blind justice
I can be that man who saves the day

She'll see what I could be
A cold routine or something
It just won't stop touching me
And I wait here another time
Like a thousand times before
I'm dropping out and faded
But I keep on wanting more

She comes up another time
And she really really doesn't care
That I can't keep time or the rhythm straight
'Cause it's one thing she don't dare
And it's alright I drop the line
Now it's one thing to be free
Well I never really had a thing for that
But it's everything I need

* And you don't ever understand
It's right here in our hands
The outline of our lives
It's over now

And she wakes up from a deeper sleep
A nightmare through and through
She won't stop trippin' on the daytime vibe
But that's one thing I won't do
Then it's over and back again
And she's still on the attack
But I'm convinced I've found a reason
To keep her coming back

Until you find that special

And you won't ever be happier
Until you find that only way
Until you find the only way back home

I could love you like the sister

And I'll send ya

And you held and you tried
I could never find another
If you walk me to the car park

There was hardly lust between us
I will love you
I won't let go

Just say that we agree and then never change 
Soften a bit until we all just get along 
But that's disregard 
You find another friend and you discard 
As you lose the argument in a cable car 
Hanging above as the canyon comes between and

I'm becoming the part that don't last 
I'm losing you and its effortless 
Without a sound we lose sight of the ground 
In the throw around 
Never thought that you wanted to bring it down 
I won't let it go down til we torch it ourselves

Twisting heartache into fine little pieces that avoid an awful crime

A little time spent deleting the scenes
And you talk of love and i don't know what it means

Girl you're so pretty and you fake it so well
Now disregard the pretty words that i wrote
And i'll learn to talk without a lump in the throat

How did it ever come to this?
Well you talk of love and i don't know what it is
How everybody gets this feeling
Oh well i cannot feel a thing

So keep your red dress out of the rain
And will you drag me to the shallows again?

I only wanna drag you down in the dirt

More than I could offer

That's what I've become
I let myself in
Though I know I'm not supposed to but
I never know when I'm done
And I see you fogging up the mirror
Vapor around your body glistens in the shower
And I want to stay right here
And go down on you for an hour
And stay and let the day just fade away in wild dedication
Take the moment of hope and let it run
And never look back at all the damage we have done now
To each other, to each other, to each other


But when I see you
It's like I'm staring down the sun
And I'm blinded
There's nothing left to do
And still I see you


I never believe that things would happen for a reason and
They never go as planned
I wanted to thank you for a vision that was lost that you returned
But you're past where you understand

Little else is known
'Cept she's a little angry
Grabs a towel, looks away
The heat fades with the day
And I fall down on what to say
Oh something clean, let me be clever
Hey oh well, whatever
But that's not what I mean
Where we've been has left us burnt still
I won't turn now from a fight
You know I'll never win

We become the things we do
Me, I'm a fool spent from defiance, yeah you got me but
I didn't give up on you
Icarus is not a T-shirt or a swan song, no
He is born again and
It's not easy being me
When I can't promise I will mend
Or bend when you believe
That we are fixed now from our birth
And I've just fallen back to Earth
Still you know I'll try again
'Cause I believe that we are lucky
We are golden, we have stolen
Manners in the days when we were one


So when I see you
In spite of all that we've become
I'm still blinded
But I'm still staring down the sun
When I see you
When I see you
When I see you
When I see you

Oh yeah!
I'm still staring down the sun

Feel my head explode from a night of gin
Another night out late
I don’t want to drink don’t want to be a clown
I got to get my feet back on the ground
Before it pulls me in

How come it ended up like this
And who’s gonna catch me when I’m coming down to hit the ground again

All by myself “waking up at 12 in my clothes again”
Cause I don’t want to drag you down hold you down
Cause you’re a friend, I blame myself “feel my head explode from a night of gin”
I guess you think it’s funny now, funny now

On the underground with the freaks and frowns
Looking at the world through silver clouds
But then it all came down
I’ve got to rise above the emotional flood
I’ve got to cut these ropes around my hands
Pull myself around

How come it ended up like this
And who’s gonna be there when I’ve lost control I’m heading to crashland

Someday, someday

When we was young ah man did we have fun
Always, always
Promises they break before they're made
Sometimes, sometimes

Oh my ex says I'm lacking in depth
I will do my best
You say you want to stay by my side
Darling your head's not right
You see alone we stand together we fall apart
Yea I think I'll be all right
I'm working so I wont have to try so hard
Tables they turn sometimes, oh someday
I ain't wasting no more time

Trying, trying

And now my fears they come to me in threes
So I, sometimes
They fade my friend, you say the strangest things
I find, sometimes

Oh my ex says I'm lacking in depth
Say I will try my best
You say you want to stay by my side

105,Perfect (Remastered),The Lightning Seeds(라이트닝 시즈),"See the rivers filled with rain
I wish it could be blue again
Hazy petrol nights
Crimson sun on traffic lights
A perfect day a perfect night
Tell me all those perfect lies
And lie back in the garden 'till it's light
Streets get full up every night
With people buzzing round the lights
And waving at the taxis driving by
Now tomorrow's here today
And yesterday's today's just fade away
Watch the morning chase the night
Rolling home, it's getting light
Feeling sleepy, full of wine
Fall in bed, just in time
The perfect stare of perfect eyes
That kiss you as they tell you lies
And wonder where you're going, 
where've you been
In towers high with time to fill
Gardens on your window sill
In between the pavement and the sky
Now tomorrow's here today
And yesterday's today's just fade away
Tell me why 
all the words will never come out right
Fumbling blind
, I've been driving through the danger signs
A perfect day a perfect night
Tell me all those perfect lies
And lie back in the garden 'till it's light
Perfect silence me and you
It's really me, I really do
Remember every moment magnified
Now tomorrow's here today
And yesterday's today's just fade away
Tell me why 
all the words will never come out right
Fumbling blind,
 I've been driving through the danger signs"
106,I Will Follow You Into The Dark,Death Cab For Cutie(데스 캡 포 큐티),"Love of mine some day you will die
But I'll be close behind
I'll follow you into the dark

No blinding light or tunnels to gates of white
Just our hands clasped so tight
Waiting for the hint of a spark
If heaven and hell decide
That they both are satisfied
Illuminate the no's on their vacancy signs

If there's no one beside you
When your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

In Catholic school as vicious as Roman rule
I got my knuckles brusied by a lady in black
And I held my toungue as she told me
""Son fear is the heart of love""
So I never went back

If heaven and hell decide
That they both are satisfied
Illuminate the no's on their vacancy signs

If there's no one beside you
When your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

You and me have seen everything to see
From Bangkok to Calgary
And the soles of your shoes are all worn down
The time for sleep is now
It's nothing to cry about
Cause we'll hold each other soon
The blackest of rooms

If heaven and hell decide
That they both are satisfied
Illuminate the no's on their vacancy signs

If there's no one beside you
When your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark
Then I'll follow you into the dark"
107,The World I Know,Collective Soul(콜렉티브 소울),"Has our conscience shown?
Has the sweet breeze blown?
Has all kindness gone?
Hope still lingers on

I drink myself of new-found pity
Sitting alone in New York City,
And I don't know why

Are we listening?
Hymns of offering
Have we eyes to see?
Love is gathering

All the words that I've been reading
Have now started the act of bleeding
Into one, into one

So I walk up on high,
And I step to the edge
To see my world below
And I laugh at myself
While the tears roll down
'Cause it's the world I have known
It's the world I have known

I drink myself of new-found pity
Sitting alone in New York City
And I don't know why
Don't know why

So I walk up on high,

To see my world below
And I laugh at myself
While the tears roll down
'Cause it's the world I have known

The memories in shadows

Come alive, there are thoughts unclear

109,Photograph,Nickelback(니클백),"Look at this photograph  
Everytime I do it makes me laugh  
How did our eyes get so red  
And what the hell is on Joey's head 

And this is where I grew up  
I think the present owner fixed it up 
I never knew we'd ever went without 
The second floor is hard for sneaking out 

And this is where I went to school  
Most of the time had better things to do  
Criminal record says I've broke in twice 
I must have done it half a dozen times  

I wonder if it's too late 
Should I go back and try to graduate 
Life's better now than it was back then
If I was them I wouldn't let me in  

Every memory of looking out the back door 
I have the photo album spread out 
on my bedroom floor 
It's hard to say it time to say it  
Goodbye goodbye 

Every memory of walking out the front door 
I found the photo of the friend 
that I was looking for  
It's hard to say it time to say it 
Goodbye goodbye 

Remember the old arcade 
Blew every dollar that we ever made 
The cops hated us hanging out 
They said somebody went and burned it down 

We used to listen to the radio 
And sing along with every song we know 
We said someday we'd find out how if feels   
To sing to more than just the steering wheel 

Kim's the first girl I kissed 
I was so nervous that I nearly missed 
She's had a couple of kids since then 
I haven't seen her since God knows when 

Every memory of looking out the back door 
I have the photo album spread out 
on my bedroom floor 
It's hard to say it time to say it 
Goodbye goodbye 

Every memory of walking out the front door 
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for 
It's hard to say it time to say it 
Goodbye goodbye 

I miss that town  
I miss their faces 
You can't erase 
You can't replace it  

I miss it now 
I can't belive it 
So hard to stay 
So hard to leave it  

If I could I relive those days 
I know the one thing that would never change

Every memory of looking out the back door 
I have the photo album spread out 
on my bedroom floor 
It's hard to say it time to say it 
Goodbye goodbye 

Every memory of walking out the front door 
I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for 
It's hard to say it time to say it 
Goodbye goodbye 

Look at this photograph 
Everytime I do it makes me laugh 
Everytime I do it makes me"

120,홍대 R&B,비비(BIBI),"돈 한 푼 없이도 헤맬 수 있는 홍대거리
나는 저들과 다르다 믿는 이들의 어림
겨울바람에 내놓은 여인의 가는 다리에
미숙한 영혼을 끌어모으는 낡은 손짓
화장실은 오른쪽 흡연구역 깊은 곳
휘청이는 탈색모 전화를 돌려봐도
아무도 받지 않고 빌어먹을 청춘은
눈치 없는 발정에 작은 몸 하나 누일 곳 없어
망가져 망가져 버린 나와 닮은 듯 닮은 듯해 넌
이가 빠진 헤진 동네 이유 없이 비싼 값 나와 닮아
부러져 부러져 버린듯해 살만해 살만하다던데
뭔가 빠진 텅 빈 영혼 여유 없이 가득 찬 나와 닮아
싸구려 클럽 위스키
한잔에 만원 넘는 바가지
악기 들쳐매고 계집애들 사이 낀 반반한
인디밴드 기타리스트
관광객들의 환상
희망적인 생각
빠르게 달리다 넘어진 스케이터 보이
그 옆에 술 취한 여친
모가지 뻣뻣한 언더 래퍼 양아치
어린 여자 꼬실 때나 오는 유명 인사 오빠
타투와 피어싱 음악과 술
담배 연기 쩌든 달셋방을
떠나지 못해
박지도 못하는 게
다들 참 비슷해

결국엔 사랑인 줄 모르겠단 너를

Sometimes you gotta take a chance while it's there

We don't need to hold back, not for a minute
I'm painting a picture and I want you in it
Anything you dream of, I'll let you live it
I just need to know if we're going somewhere

[Chorus]
Or are we waving at cars? Just
Watching them pass, is
That who we are? Just
Stuck at the start, we're
Watching them go back
Waiting for our right
Wondering if we're gonna be alright

[Post-Chorus]
Waving at cars
Wishing they were ours
Why are we waving at cars? Just
Watching them pass, is
That who we are?
Just waving at cars


[Verse 2]
We could spend the night going round in circles
Talking about all the fears we share
Or we could just go get those windows open
And you and I could finally go somewhere

We don't need to hold back, not for a minute
I'm painting a picture and I want you in it
Anything you dream of, I'll let you live it
I just need to know if we're going somewhere

Invited strangers who don’t know how I feel  
Deep down
D**n I hate this town  uh yeah
And 26 don’t treat me well all the time
I really miss some of the things left behind
Back home
Kind of feel alone

I Look Around 
Wonder where I’m at 
Guess I’m in the 

Hall of Fame 
Chilling next to Kurt Cobain 
Everybody knows my name 
they sing my song
Nothing ever could go wrong 
In the Hall of Fame 
24K golden frame 
Even If the the sky falls down it starts to rain 
It's always sunny in the Hall of Fame 

And my 11 year old self would be proud 
If he could see himself
 in front of the crowd right now
Hear’em scream out loud
And I’d do it again in a heartbeat 
Though I know what it does to my head
Maybe I should slow down 
But time keeps keeps running ahead  
Ahead in the

Hall of Fame 
Chilling next to Kurt Cobain 
Everybody knows my name
 they sing my song
Nothing ever could go wrong 
In the Hall of Fame 
24K golden frame 
Even If the the sky falls down
it starts to rain 
It's always sunny in the Hall of Fame 

I look around wonder where I’m at 
Last few years flew by so fast
Don’t remember yesterday 
I guess this really is

Hall of Fame 
Chilling next to Kurt Cobain 
Everybody knows my name
they sing my song
Nothing ever could go wrong 
In the Hall of Fame 
24K golden frame 
Even if the the sky falls down
it starts to rain 
It's always sunny in the Hall of Fame 
It’s always sunny
It’s always sunny
In the morning and the afternoon
It's always sunny in the Hall of Fame"

You know I love to hear the music
when it's too loud
I shut my mind off
My heads a ghost town
Then I pour another then I pour another like
Oooh my Fahrenheit is burning
through the roof right now
And I'm feeling featherlight again
I wanna live like every night
I'll see all of my friends somehow
Cause I'm sipping on what I like again
You know I'm sipping on what I like again
I just love the way
I'm living an elusive dream
By the time I'm out the door
I won't remember anything
I'll meet someone at the bar

Touching backseat of the car

And now I'm wrapped up in her arms

My cards folded waiting for you babe
You've got a hold of me
I'm diving in head first
Hoping I could love you so recklessly
It hit me like
A tidal wave I'm falling off
You got me hypnotized mesmerized
Wrapped around your finger
Till the lights go low
You've got a hold of me
A hold of me"
147,Holy (feat. Chance The Rapper),Justin Bieber(저스틴 비버),"I hear a lot about sinners
Don't think that I'll be a saint
But I might go down to the river
'Cause the way that the sky opens up
When we touch
Yeah it's makin' me say
That the way you hold me hold me
Hold me hold me hold me
Feels so holy holy holy holy holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me hold me
Hold me hold me hold me
Feels so holy
I don't do well with the drama
And no I can't stand it being fake
(No no no no no no no no)
I don't believe in nirvana
But the way that we love
In the night gave me life
Baby I can't explain
That the way you hold me hold me
Hold me hold me hold me
Feels so holy holy holy holy holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me hold me
Hold me hold me hold me
Feels so holy

The pimps and the players say
Don't go crushin'
Wise men say fools rush in

The first step pleases the Father
Might be the hardest to take
But when you come out of the water
I'm a believer my heart is fleshy
Life is short with a temper like Joe Pesci
They always come and sing your praises
Your name is catchy
But they don't see you how I see you
Parlay and Desi
Cross Tween Tween Hesi' hit the jet speed
When they get messy
Go lefty like Lionel Messi
Let's take a trip and get the Vespas
Or rent a Jet Ski
I know the spots that got the best weed
We goin' next week
I wanna honor wanna honor you
Bride's groom I'm my father's child
I know when the son takes the first steps
The Father's proud (Yes)
If you make it to the water
He'll part the clouds (Uh)
I know He made you a snack
Like Oscar Proud (Mwah)
Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up (Ooh)
Formalize the union in communion
He can trust (Woo)
I know I ain't leavin' you like
I know He ain't leavin' us (Ah)
I know we believe in God
And I know God believes in us
'Cause the way you hold me hold me
Hold me hold me hold me
Feels so holy holy holy holy holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second on God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second on God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me
Hold me hold me hold me
Feels so ho ho ho holy"
148,Rewrite The Stars,Zac Efron(잭 에프론),"You know I want you
It's not a secret I try to hide
I know you want me
So don't keep saying our hands are tied
You claim it's not in the cards
And fate is pulling you miles away
And out of reach from me
But you're here in my heart
So who can stop me
If I decide that you're my destiny?
What if we rewrite the stars?
Say you were made to be mine
Nothing could keep us apart
You'd be the one I was meant to find
It's up to you
And it's up to me
No one can say what we get to be
So why don't we rewrite the stars?
Maybe the world could be ours
Tonight
You think it's easy
You think I don't want to run to you
But there are mountains
And there are doors that we can't walk through
I know you wondering why
Because we're able to be
Just you and me within these walls
But when we go outside
You're going to wake up and see that
It was hopeless after all
No one can rewrite the stars
How can we say you'll be mine
Everything keeps us apart
And I'm not the one you were meant to find
It's not up to you
It's not up to me
When everyone tells us what we can be
How can we rewrite the stars?
Say that the world can be ours
Tonight
All I want is to fly with you
All I want is to fall with you
So just give me all of you
It feels impossible
It's not impossible
Is it impossible?
Say that it's possible
How do we rewrite the stars?
Say you were meant to be mine
Nothing can keep us apart
Cause you are the one I was meant to find
It's up to you
And it's up to me
No one can say what we get to be
Why don't we rewrite the stars?
Changing the world to be ours
You know I want you
It's not a secret I try to hide
But I can't have you
We're bound to break and my hands are tied"

You said light my cigarette
So I lied to my mom and dad
And jumped the fence and I ran
But we couldn't go very far
'Cause you locked your keys in your car
So you sat and stared at my lips
And I could already feel your kiss
Long nights daydreams
Sugar and smoke rings I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes
Always taste like you
Headlights on me
Racing to sixty I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes
Always taste like
Blue eyes black jeans
Lighters and candy I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes
Always taste like you
Remember when you taught me fate
Said it all be worth the wait
Like that night in the back of the cab
When your fingers walked in my hand
Next day nothing on my phone
But I can still smell you on my clothes
Always hoping things would change
But we went right back to your games
Long nights daydreams
Sugar and smoke rings I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes
Always taste like you
Headlights on me
Racing to sixty I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes
Always taste like
Blue eyes black jeans
Lighters and candy I've been a fool
But strawberries and cigarettes
Always taste like you
And even if I run away
And give my heart a holiday
Still strawberries and cigarettes
Always taste like you
You always leave me wanting more

Tell them that life's no good without
And with nothing left to lose
Nothing left to prove
Are you gonna tell the truth?
What would you do?
They say a smile can really brighten your night
We're stuck on this rock together rocking for life
This music jamming I'm just here for the vibe
I'm gonna tell someone I love them tonight
Why not tell somebody you love them
Before it's too late?
Why not tell somebody you love them
Cause it cannot wait?
Just tell somebody you love them

가는 소리 들려도 내 맘에 소비 기간은 없어
너 없는 이곳에 모든 시간도

Like we are in the present
Drinking from plastic cups
Singing love is forever and ever

On an old mustang where we sang
Songs with all our childhoods friends
And it went like this yeah
Oops I got 99 problems
Singing bye bye bye
Hold up if you wanna go
And take a ride with me
Better hit me baby one more time
Paint a picture for you and me
On the days when we were young
Singing at the top of both our lungs
Now we're under the covers
Fast forward to eighteen
We are more than lovers
Yeah we are all we need
When we're holding each other
I'm taken back to 2002
Dancing on the hood
In the middle of the woods
On an old mustang where we sang
Songs with all our childhoods friends
And it went like this yeah
Oops I got 99 problems
Singing bye bye bye
Hold up if you wanna go
And take a ride with me
Better hit me baby one more time

My universe (You you are)
My universe (I just want)
My universe (You you are)
My universe and I
My universe"

Honey honey
I can see the stars all the way from here
Can't you see the glow on the window pane?
I can feel the sun whenever you're near
Every time you touch me I just melt away
Now everybody asks me
Why I'm smiling out from ear to ear
(They say love hurts)
But I know
(It's gonna take the real work)
Nothing's perfect
But it's worth it after fighting through my tears
And finally you put me first
Baby it's you
You're the one I love
You're the one I need
You're the only one I see
Come on baby it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need you make everything stop
Finally you put my love on top
Ooo come on baby
You put my love on top top top top top
You put my love on top
Ooo ooo come on baby
You put my love on top top top top top
My love on top
My love on top
Come on baby
I can feel the wind whipping past my face
As we dance the night away
Boy your lips taste like a night of champagne
As I kiss you again and again
And again and again
Now everybody asks me
Why I'm smiling out from ear to ear
(They say love hurts)
But I know
(It's gonna take the real work)
Nothing's perfect

Iggy Iggy
Too biggie to be here stressin'
I'm thinkin' I love the thought of you
More than I love your presence
And the best thing now
Is probably for you to exit
I let you go
Let you back
I finally learned my lesson!
No half-stepping
Either you want it or you just keep playin'
I'm listening to you knowin'
I can't believe what you're sayin'
There's a million you's baby boo
So don't be dumb

I don't think that I like her anymore
Cause they're all the same
They just wanna see me fall apart apart (Oh oh)

But I find out eventually I'm not her type

193,Anti-Hero,Taylor Swift(테일러 스위프트),"I have this thing where I get older
But just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)
It's me hi
I'm the problem it's me
At teatime everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun
But never in the mirror
It must be exhausting
Always rooting for the anti hero
Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out
Slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart but never killed
Did you hear my covert narcissism
I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
(A tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)
It's me hi
I'm the problem it's me
(I'm the problem it's me)
At teatime everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun
But never in the mirror
It must be exhausting
Always rooting for the anti hero
I have this dream my daughter in law kills me
For the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers around and reads it
And then someone screams out
'She's laughing up at us from hell'
It's me hi
I'm the problem it's me
It's me hi
I'm the problem it's me
It's me hi
Everybody agrees everybody agrees

How you're doing now
How's the castle built off
People you pretend to care about?
Just what you wanted
Look at you cool guy you got it
I see the parties and the diamonds sometimes
When I close my eyes
Six months of torture you sold
As some forbidden paradise
I loved you truly
You gotta laugh at the stupidity
'Cause I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so naive
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me oh
Bloodsucker fame fucker
Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire
And every girl I ever talked to told me
You were bad bad news
You called them crazy
God I hate the way I called 'em crazy too
You're so convincing
How do you lie without flinching?
(How do you lie? How do you lie?
How do you lie?)
Oh what a mesmerizing paralyzing
Fucked up little thrill
Can't figure out just how you do it
And God knows I never will
Went for me and not her
'Cause girls your age know better
I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine

As you sunk your teeth into me oh
Bloodsucker fame fucker
Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire
(Ah)
You said it was true love
But wouldn't that be hard?
You can't love anyone
'Cause that would mean you had a heart
I tried to help you out now I know that I can't
'Cause how you think's the kind of thing
I'll never understand
I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange

So go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate

Don't ask me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell,
And now you're in my way

I'd trade my soul for a wish,
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this,
But now you're in my way

Your stare was holdin',
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're going, baby?

Hey, I just met you,
And this is crazy,
But here's my number,
So call me, maybe?

It's hard to look right,
At you baby,
But here's my number,
So call me, maybe?

Hey, I just met you,
And this is crazy,
But here's my number,
So call me, maybe?

And all the other boys,
Try to chase me,
But here's my number,
So call me, maybe?

You took your time with the call,
I took no time with the fall
You gave me nothing at all,
But still, you're in my way

I beg, and borrow and steal
Have foresight and it's real
I didn't know I would feel it,
But it's in my way

Your stare was holdin',

200,bad guy,Billie Eilish(빌리 아일리시),"White shirt now red my bloody nose
Sleepin' you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul so cynical
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy duh
I'm the bad guy
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy duh
I'm the bad guy duh
I'm only good at bein' bad bad
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause
I'm wearing your cologne
I'm a bad guy
I'm a bad guy
Bad guy bad guy
I'm a bad"

Did a full one eighty crazy
Thinking bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all
So if you don't wanna see me
Dancing with somebody
If you want to believe
That anything could stop me
Don't show up
Don't come out
Don't start caring
About me now
Walk away
You know how
Don't start caring
About me now
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word goodbye
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
I'm all good already
So moved on it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all
So if you don't wanna see me
Dancing with somebody
If you want to believe
That anything could stop me
Don't show up
Don't come out
Don't start caring
About me now
Walk away

Thought that I could chase you
With a cold evening

How I'm feeling about you

And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don't want it
Even though I do (Even though I do)
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals it beats for you
I know it's forward but it's true
I wanna hold you
When I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head
And I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again
I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
We never got it right
Playing and replaying old conversations
Overthinking every word and I hate it
'Cause it's not me ('cause it's not me)
And what's the point in hiding?
Everybody knows
We got unfinished business
And I'll regret it if I didn't say
This isn't what it could be
(Isn't what it could be)
You could break my heart in two

I know I'd go back to you
You can break my heart in two
But when it heals it beats for you
I know it's forward but it's true
Won't lie I'd go back to you
You know my thoughts are running loose
It's just a thing you make me do
And I could fight but what's the use?
I know I'd go back to you
I wanna hold you
When I'm not supposed to
When I'm lying close to someone else
You're stuck in my head
And I can't get you out of it

I was living at my parents' house
I blinked and things changed
Fast forward and I was moving out
I can only exist in three dimensions at a time
Who am I to resist a river flowing left to right?
It's like we've been dancing in the dark
A great big expansion from a spark
Over in a moment
Finished in a flash
Slipping through my fingers
Life's an hourglass
Shattered on the floor oh
It'll never be the way it was before
No
Feels like yesterday
I was falling in love
Then came the heartbreak
Like it always does
Nobody escapes it
Time's a losing game
Might as well embrace it
'Till it flies away
I know that nobody can stay forever young
I wish I could just take a break
from growing up
It's like we've been dancing in the dark
A great big expansion from a spark
Over in a moment
Finished in a flash
Slipping through my fingers
Life's an hourglass
Shattered on the floor oh
It'll never be the way it was before
The way it was before
Over in a moment
Finished in a flash
Slipping through my fingers
Moving way too fast
Wish I had just a little more oh
It'll never be the way it was before"

Said that you love me

I get like this every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary
'Cause I remember every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary
Do you ever think of me?
I'm buildin' my hopes up
Like presents unopened to this day
I still see the messages you read mmm
I'm foolishly patient
Can't get past the taste of your lips
Don't wanna let you out my head
Just like the day that I met you
The day I thought forever
Said that you love me
But that'll last for never
It's cold outside like
When you walked out my life
Why you walk out my life?
I get like this every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary
'Cause I remember every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary
Do you ever think of me?
Of me
'Cause I think of you think of you"
227,Comeback,Albert Posis,"Torn inside my brain
Cause I lost sight of such a simple feeling
And I know we went our separate ways
But this was all just one misunderstanding
And I put it on you
I didn't know any better
Weighing all the pressure
Shouldn't have left you on your own
Honey I don't deserve this feeling
Hope you know that I won't
Keep you from leaving
Yeah I know that it sounds cliche
But you're still my day one
Yeah I'm coming back
Cause it's comeback season
My mind was always changing
Didn't notice that my motives
Were in vices in bad places
But I'm better where my headspace is
Took some time to reassess the situation
Trying to lose this bad reputation
In all of my times of desperation
You were the one waiting
Honey I don't deserve this feeling
Hope you know that I won't
Keep you from leaving
Yeah I know that it sounds cliche
But you're still my day one
Yeah I'm coming back
Cause it's comeback season
Baby it's time
For you to know that I'm for real
I'm done with hiding how I feel
So let's just go up from here
Cause honey you should know that I don't
Honey I don't deserve this feeling
Hope you know that I won't
Keep you from leaving
Yeah I know that it sounds cliche
But you're still my day one
Yeah I'm coming back
Cause it's comeback season"

To show me where you are
Come find me
I'm ready to be caught off guard so
If you're down to let me in entirely and inspire me
This maze could be a work of art
We both can't control
If the answer's yes or no
When your heart's ready for the truth
Maybe that's when I'll get to you
Something about me wants to know your soul
(Tell me what I want to hear)
I can't explain the way I'm feeling
(Don't wanna get close when you're near)
Your mind is something I'm not reading yet
Tell me why I always gravitate to you
Can we navigate
Open up the gates
Come closer
I feel a type of way
And I can't keep my composure
Drifting towards me
We can slowly move
Further away from the start
Cause we know
We both can't control
If the answer's yes or no
When your heart's ready for the truth
Maybe that's when I'll get to you
Something about you
Wants to know my soul

I pull away and reassess
Gotta protect me

Push the negative to the side

We gotta stop debating

I'll see you in the morning
I'll go wherever you're going

I don't need to side
Even if I had to choose
You know I'd rather be
With no one else but you
One day you will find
I'm gonna make it true
And if you don't believe then we concede
Defeat for me is inconceivable
But all I think about is what's achievable
Despite it mightn't be feasible

Putting it all on a plate and
Wrapping it up in a bow yeah

And if there's one thing that I know
Love is losing all control
But if you have to leave
Then I'll leave on the light
And if you come back I'll be waiting
If you come back I'll be right there by your side
If you come back I'll be waiting
If you come back I'll be right here every time
We burn through life
Faster than a wildfire
Can we stay frozen in time
In between hello and goodbye
You know I wanna hold you close

The moon won't ever tell the sun that it can't rise
And if there's one thing that I know
Love is losing all control

262,Break the Barrier,Miss Li(미스 리),"Can you feel the beating of the drum?
Can you hear it louder than a gun?
Can you see us tearing down the wall?
Can't deny us when you see it fall
Over mountain over seas
Let it echo set it free
Hear the lion hear the roar
Raging thunder (raging war)
It's time for water to brawl
It's time to follow your heart
It's time for buildings to shake
It's time for barriers to break
To break to break to break to break
To break to break to break to break
Can you see the devil in the church?
Hear the evil message in his words?
Try to scare us make us enemies
Try to chain us he ain't stopping me
Over mountain over seas
Let it echo set us free
Hear the lion hear the roar
Raging thunder (raging war)
It's time for water to brawl
It's time to follow your heart
It's time for buildings to shake
It's time for barriers to break
To break to break to break to break
To break to break to break to break

Can you hear the thunder rage?
(Now can you feel the building shake?)

263,Demon Mode,Stileto,"Went to hell and met some friends
Y'know it's not that bad
Cocktails and cigarettes
For sins I don't regret

[Pre-Chorus]
But someone thought it best
To raise me from the dead
So let's put on a show



I hit my demon mode (Mode)
Bow down and pray that
I don't take your soul (Soul)
You'll never see me coming
Tucked under the bed
I'll creep inside your head
And never let you go
I hit my demon mode (Run)

(I hit my demon mode)
(I hit my demon mode)

Sticks and stones, I'll break your bones
If you call out my namе
Pentagrams and crooked laughs
A curse you can't еxplain


Kick up my feet, let the fun begin
Call out the minions and the skeletons
Join us or pay the price
Eternal sacrifice



You're running out of time
And soon you'll be all mine
I'll never let you go


I hit my demon mode (Mode)
Bow down and pray that
I don't take your soul (Soul)
You'll never see me coming
Tucked under the bed
I'll creep inside your head
And never let you go
I hit my demon mode (Run)

From the clouds
So it seems the danger signs will never
Let the feelings die

Never break dividing lines

 Roll one, let's get high tonight
 Backseat, Maybach, lavish life
 Chilling with the stars like a satellite
 AP on my arm and it's shining bright

 Living in a haze, staying in the shade
 All I do is sit around and wait for better days
 I could use a break, can I get an Amen?
 All I do is sit around and wait for better days

 Sit around, sit around, sit around and wait
 For better, better, better days
 Oh, I could use a break
 Oh, better, better, better days
 For better days

 All I do is sit around and wait for better days
 Better days
 All I do is sit around and wait for better days"

292,That I Miss You,Vansire,"Headed west now
From the blighted plain
It's kind of gorgeous in a georgic way
Staring outside
Watching every change
I think it's just a type of way to explain
How I miss you
How I hope you're fine
That I've been sad
Tracing lichtensteins with my eyes closed
On the phone at night
Always bummed out
Cause the world's not right
At this time
At the drive thru
With the headlights on
And now I'm feeling like I'm roquentin
In a streetcar
Near corrine marchand
I'll go michel legrand and set it to song
How I miss you
How I hope you're fine
That I've been sad
Tracing lichtensteins with my eyes closed
On the phone at night
Always bummed out
Back in new york
In the august sun
Wandering greenpoint
While the l still runs
And I run back
To a different day
In the meantime
You can dance you can hit replay"

Different places thinking of each other
I keep hoping I might find my way to you
Darling I'm sure you're not alone
And it's nice to get attention
Called your phone
So they won't see the mentions
Let me know
If you're looking for a different view
Different view and if you stay
(Up all night)
While I'm here won't you come through
(How can I)
Make it clear that I want you
I got all this time
And you got nothing better to do
You got nothing better to do
I know you love to live without hesitation
Always looking for the next spot

더 잘 해내고 싶은 압박감에 
취해 보고 달렸지 앞만 쉬지 않고 
스스로 채찍을 쳐댔어 
넌 가끔씩 외롭고 우울하댔어
혼자 남겨질 것 같대 현실이란 우물 안에서
난 살아 보겠다고 낑낑대는데 
넌 나만 바라보며 징징대
그게 죄스럽다가도 짐스러워 
그 구속감에 때론 질식해

304,기다리는 게 맞나? (feat. BIG Naughty),식케이 (Sik-K),"기다리는 게 맞나? I wonder
목줄도 안 채워진 난 뭘까?
나는 간절함을 기다려
너의 반전 한 번을 기다렸다
사로잡혀 있는 게 문제
네 말, 말 핑계가 주제
길다 길어 널 기다린 시간만큼
난 참는데 넌 화를 내, 또 이봐 반응

넌 내가 되어본 적이 없어
내 기분이 어떤지 몰라
이건 나도 마찬가지
난 평생 네가 되어본 적이 없어
앞으로도 그럴 수가 없고 이제 간단하지

에게 겨우 간에 기별은 가네
사람들은 쉽게 이별을 말해
아니 이별이 쉬운 일처럼 말해
그중에 한 명이 지금 넌데
워낙 Automatic and selfish
나 말고 네 얘기
난 어디 하나 고장이 나 있겠지
 	  
고장이 나 있는 꼴
난 상황 파악이 늦어
복잡한 와중에 딱 한 가지 생각
기다리는 게 맞냐고요 매일 밤

기다리는 게 맞나 I wonder
혼자 줄다리 하다 Now I know
네가 내 목에 채우고 간 건
목줄이 아니라 목걸이였다

기다림을 다려 다리미에
이 시간의 주름을 다 가리기엔
빠르게 흘러가는 타이밍 Gotta get 
That safe ASAP 몰라 
너의 한마디에
난 열두 마디를 비행해
구름 사이를 피해
도착한 결말은 해피해 
You know that I'm your sun 왜 무서워해
네 새벽 앞에선 나도 서행해

처음이라 그래 무서워서 그래
네 맘과 네 말이 다른게
어때서그래, 과대해석을 해
어색해서 그래 
요즘 난 조롱이나 당해
사실 뭐 당해도 마땅해
걱정하지말고 빨리 졸업이나 해 

기다리는 게 맞나? I wonder
줄다리기하다 now I know
나는 간절함을 기다려
너의 반전 한 번을 기다렸다

마른 한숨을 내쉬며 그늘진 얼굴 쓸어내려
유연했던 입꼬리는 주저 없이 흘러내려
매일 밤 흐느끼겠지 추억의 무덤에서
우리가 주고받던 수많은 질문과 대답
시시콜콜한 농담 뒤에 이어질
웃음소리까지 그걸 어떻게 가슴에 묻어

알아서 돌아가던가
다시금 돌아와 주던가 해

'Cause I know, I know I can't help myself
I can't help myself


Why, why
Do we keep it all inside
Keep pretending like we're fine?
Oh, why, why
Do we hide behind our eyes?
All the tears we should've cried"
319,Body Better (Acoustic),Maisie Peters,"I was good to you
Could lay my head upon your chest
And hear I was good for you
Got your heartbeat at its best
You were it for me
Did I just not do it for you, superficially?
'Cause you were it for me

'Cause it was nothing I did and nothing I said
And I know I gave you all of myself, one hundred percent
And now I'm watching you moving on in the beat of a drum
So, if I never gave you any reason to run

Then I, I can't help thinking that she's got a better body
Has she got a body better than mine?
And I, I can't help thinking, when you touched it, were you sorry?
Werе you sorry like you weren't at thе time?
Loving you was easy, that's why it hurts now
The worst way to love somebody is to watch them love somebody else and it work out
Now, I can't help thinking that she's got a better body
Has she got a body better than mine?

Do you love her?
When you're twisting up all her sheets, do you suffer?
Do I sit there and watch you sleep?
If you love her
Was I just an idea you liked?
A convenient use of time
With obedient blue eyes

You took what you took and you left what you left
And I don't know how I still can't make it make any sense

Now I, I can't help thinking that she's got a better body
Has she got a body better than mine?
And I, I can't help thinking, when you touched it, were you sorry?
Were you sorry like you weren't at the time?
Loving you was easy, that's why it hurts now
The worst way to love somebody is to watch them love somebody else and it work out
Now, I can't help thinking that she's got a better body
Has she got a body better than mine?

All the hows and the whens and whys
I thought it would be us for life
Was I wrong and is she so right?
Is her body better than mine?
All the clothes and the warning signs
How's it feel to have made me cry?
Will you tell me just one more lie?
Is her body better than mine?

I can't help thinking that she's got a better body
Has she got a body better than mine?
I can't help thinking, when you touched it, were you sorry?
Were you sorry like you weren't at the time?
Loving you was easy, that's why it hurts now
The worst way to love somebody is to watch them love somebody else and it work out
Now, I can't help thinking that she's got a better body
Has she got a body better than mine?"
320,Eyes Closed,Ed Sheeran(에드 시런),"I know it's a bad idea
But how can I help myself
Been inside for most this year
And I thought a few drinks they might help

It's been a while my dear
Dealing with the cards life dealt
I'm still holding back these tears
While my friends are somewhere else

I pictured this year a little bit different 
when it hit February 
I step in the bar it hit me so hard
Oh how can it be this heavy?
Every song reminds me you're gone 
And I feel the lump form in my throat
'Coz I'm here alone

Just dancing with my eyes closed
'Coz everywhere I look I still see you
Time is moving so slow
And I don't know what else that I can do
So I'll keep dancing with my eyes closed
So I'll keep dancing with my

Delusion is here again
And I think you'll come home soon
A word brings me right back in
Then it's only me that's in this room
I guess I could just pretend
The colours are more than blue
But I lost more than my friend
I can't help but missing you

I pictured this month a little bit different 
no one is ever ready
And when it unfolds you get in a hole
Oh how can it be this heavy?
Everything changes nothing's the same
Except the truth is now you're gone
And life just goes on

So I'm dancing with my eyes closed
'Coz everywhere I look I still see you
Time is moving so slow
And I don't know what else that I can do
So I'll keep dancing with my eyes closed
So I'll keep dancing with my eyes closed
Oh I'll keep dancing with my

They're shutting the bar
They're cleaning the floor
And everyone is already home
But I'm on my own

Still dancing with my eyes closed
'Coz everywhere I look I still see you

Bursting upon us
All my flaws lying on the ground
In the

I'm not a stranger
Black hearted angel
Oh, I hate when you're not around

Some days I don't feel a thing at all

325,Pointless,Lewis Capaldi,"I bring her coffee in the morning
She brings me inner peace
I take her out to fancy restaurants
She takes the sadness out of me
I make her cards on her birthday
She makes me a better man
I take her water when she's thirsty
She takes me as I am

I love it when her mind wanders
And she loves it when I stay at home
I know when she's lost and she knows when I feel alone

From all my airs and graces
To the little things I do
Everything is pointless without you
Of all the dreams I'm chasing
There's only one I choose
Everything is pointless without you

I light the fire when it's cold out
And she lights up the room
I hope that she'll love me forever
She hopes I'll be back soon
I take her out to the movies
She takes away my pain
She is the start of everything
And I'll be there till the end

I love when she laughs for no reason
And her love's the reason I'm here
She knows when I'm hurt and I know when she's feeling scared

From all my airs and graces
To the little things I do
Everything is pointless without you
Of all the dreams I'm chasing
There's only one I choose
Everything is pointless without you

I'll wait for you
I'll wait for you
You'll wait for me too
I'll wait for you

You took my heart
And stole it from my home
Seoul you're in my soul
I had no plan to fall in love with you
Just tryin to escape all of my issues
I see the rain dancing down your hair
I like a girl who doesn't care
Sarang my love
Different but the same
So wrong to fall
But I don't want this to change
Take my hand don't be shy
Let's not waste the night
Give me a taste of what you like
Bring this city to life
Take my hand don't be shy
Let's not waste the night
Give me a taste of what you like

330,Story Of Love (Radio Edit),Bon Jovi(본 조비),"Fathers love daughters like mothers love sons
They've been writing our story before there was one
From the day you arrive, till you walk, till you run
There is nothing but pride, there is nothing but love

They can offer advice that you don't wanna hear
Words that cut like a knife and still ring in your ear
You think of them ignorant, they think of you arrogant
If you need evidence, who gave you confidence?

A snap of the finger and you're not a child
But you're still holding on as you walk down the aisle
When they give you away to hear someone else say
That someone will love you till their dying day

Fathers love daughters like mothers love sons
They've been writing our story before there was one
From the day you arrive till you walk, till you run
There is nothing but pride, there is nothing but love

And that's the story of love
You can choose to remember or choose to forget
If they took you to school or they tucked you in bed
You can say it don't matter, you won't do the same
You'd think no one noticed when you looked away


Fathers love daughters like mothers love sons
They've been writing our story before there was one
From the day you arrive till you walk, till you run
There is nothing but pride, there is nothing but love

Now they're getting older and you ain't so young
So you take care of them like your daughters and sons
You can ask for forgiveness, they could ask for the same
Forget all the anguish, the heartache, the pain

Wherever you go or wherever you've been
It's them that is with you and that's you that's with them
Fathers and daughters and mothers and sons
As one story ends another's, another's begun

Oh, fathers love daughters like mothers love sons
They've been writing our story before there was one
From the day you arrive till you walk, till you run
There is nothing but pride, there is nothing but love
From hello to goodbye that's the story of love
That's the story of love

331,Tail End (Feat. Hugo),Phum Viphurit,"I don't want to die feeling like 
I wasted my life away
But I wake up feeling wasted everyday

That's what John said I kept him company
He's drowning in misery
He drags on a cigarette
But all he taste is regret

And as the words slip from his lips
He took his so called final sip
Casting the world a sigh
To stop the calm and tide

At the tail end of pleasure
At the tail end of pleasure
At the tail end of pleasure
At the tail end of pleasure
It feels like nothing at all

The final drag deep and long
Like a farewell before a storm
Terrified to turn inside and regard the final fall
Lets leave it before they turn all the lights on
Oh
I don't want to find out
Where everyone's gone

At the tail end of pleasure
At the tail end of pleasure
At the tail end of pleasure
At the tail end of pleasure
You don't feel like nothing at all

You don't feel like nothing at all
You don't feel like nothing at all
You don't feel like nothing at all

It's all familiar
Oh I'm just waiting a fall
Into a dawn
I'm really not that ready for

Well can we pretend
It's all like it was before
I guess not
It's hard to remember the things we forgot

At the tail end of pleasure
At the tail end of pleasure
At the tail end of pleasure
At the tail end of pleasure
You don't feel like nothing at all

I always thought that I'd be rich, yeah
But now I'm 26 and I ain’t got shit yet
Makin' music, writing songs, tryna fix it

But growing up I always thought that I'd be famous
And every body around would know what my name is
But now I'm barely affording my car payments
I can't take it, I gotta change it

Well I say let me judge that for myself

Singing Ray Charles when I leave her
But when I hit the road jack
I'm coming back to see ya
Cherry on your lips
No it couldn't taste any sweeter
Rockstar little moonshine
In the daylight you're a diva

You probably won't meet my mama
It's fine cause I don't think you wanna
It's better avoiding the drama
Keep all our problems under the covers
No better time when it's raining
You pull up to pull out the blankets
You in and out like LA shit
Damn you're my favourite

Should I feel bad for the neighbours
They haven't complained yet
But they probably hate us
Now you got me
Love drunk off of your fragrance
We're practically strangers
Though it feels like
I've known you for ages

Got a phone call from Porsche
In my hotel in Bora Bora
I forgot where I was stepped outside
And fell into the water
Really hard to ignore ya
With that rose colour scheme aura
In the back of your truck
Yellow tunnel it's a summer dream for ya

I really don't know shit about you
That's something that we'll get around to
When we got a minute to spare
But this loving affair is what it come down to
Baby I'm already knee-up
But don't wanna sink any deeper
Know that you don't want it either
Though you a keeper

Should I feel bad for the neighbours
They haven't complained yet
But they probably hate us
Now you got me
Love drunk off of your fragrance

Up until the last sunrise
I'll be reaching for you
Wanting you is all i know
and loving you is out of my control
so I'm letting go and going down
Cause nothing lasts forever
anymore
But no one's felt the way i feel before
Cause
You sweep the floor beneath me
And I'm falling
I'm infinitely falling
For you
I'm falling
I'm infinitely falling
With all that I am to the last drop
The more of you I get I can't stop
Lights always green
Real as a dream
And you've been the cherry that's on top
The voice in my heads getting so loud
All I can see is your here now
And so I'm letting go and going down
Cause nothing lasts forever
anymore
We float above the way it felt before

You sweep the floor beneath me
And I'm falling
I'm infinitely falling"

You for the very first time
Forgot you smell like cherries
And you taste like wine
Just like a French rose
I could sip you all through the night
Baby oh you know you got me crazy
Thinking about you on the daily
I'm laying in the sun
Just drinking every drop of your love
And lately you're
My favorite game to play baby
I'll be your damsel come and save me
I'm laying in the sun
Just drinking every drop of your love
Are you some magician
'Cause I'm under your spell
I'm looking up to heaven
Is that where you fell?
It felt so bitter
But now it's sweet as hell
I've been waiting so
Long to get that midnight dance
To feel your skin up on mine
Like we're all in a trance
It's in the summer air
An old school kind of romance
Baby oh you know you got me crazy
Thinking about you on the daily
I'm laying in the sun dressed
Drinking every drop of your love
And lately you're my favorite game
To play baby
I'll be your damsel come and save me
I'm laying in the sun
Just drinking every drop of your love
And it's the night draws in
After a sunkissed day
I'm feeling drunk on your love
Oh baby please say you'll stay
You quench my thirst like the first time
I drank rose
Drinking every drop of your love
Oh baby oh you know you got me crazy
Thinking about you on the daily

346,Jesus in LA,Alec Benjamin(알렉 벤자민),"Well, I shook hands with the devil
Down on the south side
And he bought us both a drink
With a pad and a pencil sat by his side
I said, ""Tell me what you think""
I've been looking for my savior, looking for my truth
I even asked my shrink
He brought me down to his level
Said, ""Son, you're not special
You won't find him where you think""
You won't find him down on Sunset
Or at a party in the hills
At the bottom of the bottle
Or when you're tripping on some pills
When they sold you the dream you were just 16
Packed a bag and ran away
And it's a crying shame you came all this way
'Cause you won't find Jesus in LA
And it's a crying shame you came all this way
'Cause you won't find Jesus in LA
Took a sip of his whiskey
Said, ""Now that you're with me
Well, I think that you should stay""
Yeah, I know you've been busy
Searching through the city
So let me share the way
I know I'm not your savior
Know I'm not your truth
But I think we could be friends
He said ""Come down to my level
Hang out with the devil
Let me tell you, in the end
You won't find him down on sunset
Or at a party in the hills
At the bottom of the bottle
Or when you're tripping on some pills
When they sold you the dream you were just 16
Packed a bag and ran away
And it's a crying shame you came all this way
'Cause you won't find Jesus in LA
And it's a crying shame you came all this way
'Cause you won't find Jesus in LA""
And that is when I knew that it was time to go home
And that is when I realized that I was alone
And all the vibrant colors from the lights fade away
And I don't care what they say
You won't find him down on sunset
Or at a party in the hills
At the bottom of the bottle
Or when you're tripping on some pills
When they sold you the dream you were just 16
Packed a bag and ran away
And it's a crying shame you came all this way
'Cause you won't find Jesus in LA
I won't find him down on sunset
Or at a party in the hills
At the bottom of the bottle
Or when I'm tripping on some pills
When they sold me the dream I was just 16

 It don't bother me if you're old or young
 If you got lots of money or you got next to none
 Or where you think we all go when we die

 It ain't on my mind if you're big or small
 How long it takes you to get up when you fall
 Or if you can or cannot handle the spice

 In a world where you can be anything
 I'll be kind to you
 Could you be kind to me?

 It don't bother me what SPF you use
 Or if the body you're born in don't define you
 We're all taking different ways into Rome
 If you get off to guys, girls, both kind
 Or someone in between
 Or like to dress up even when it ain't Halloween
 I don't mind, I say each to their own

 In a world where you can be anything
 I'll be kind to you

I and I plus five heading Kanye West
Off the tip of Argentina
Better than drowning in gin

With a view from my apartment

On the corner like a stoplight yeah

Never showed up for the showbiz

I've got my passes panoramic 
'round your fingertips

I wanted to tell ya I fell in before it's over
And I wanted to make the file 
before my trial runs out

You give me 3 dimensional feelings
Thought that I was just dreaming
Can't keep up with them all
I see 3 dimensional feelings
Bouncing off of the ceiling
Coming off of the wall

Turu turu turu turu turu turu tu I love it
Turu turu turu turu turu turu tu I do

All my emotions are explosions into stereo
I don't just feel them I convert them into audio
End of a rainbow geometric like a movie script
And now a touch feels so electric 
at my finger tips

I wanted to tell ya I fell in before it's over
And I wanted to make the file

속이며 차분하게 말했지 '지금 집'

And I say 너만이 흐려 보여 멀리
편안해져 조금씩

왜 이제서야 넌 나를 또 흔들어
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

마주친 순간처럼 right here
마주친 순간처럼 멈춰있어
난 right here
바라는 게 많아 내가 너에게
뭐 딱히
사람들 조롱 속에
놀아나도
피하는 게 버릇이 된
내 신세는 도망자로
너도 잘 알다시피
난 아직은 어린 새끼
지만 서울의
어두운 면은
박혔지 뇌리에
깊게 빌게 후회
따윈 뒤에 절대 난 할 일이 없게
웃는 표정 지으며 널 반길래
진심을 눌러 담아 쓴 편지 한 장
상처와 아픔은 남아 있다 우릴
잡아줄 길이 될까나
사계절을 두 번 돌아
이제 세 번째로
가까운 미래에
너와 손을 잡고
imma say hello to you
그대로 있어 줘
나 닿지 못해도
멀리서도 볼 수 있게
누군 바보 같대
그래 바보 맞네
괜찮아 널 볼 수 있다면
약속했던 것처럼 right here
마주친 순간처럼 right here
약속했던 것처럼 right here
마주친 순간처럼 right here
가끔 강요받아 떠나길,
cuz they don't wanna see me win
어쩜 적어 나는 시 따윌,
혼자 간직하지 미친 dream
근데 아직 여기 남아 right here,
한숨 뱉고 다시 마셔
난 무조건 원해 자리 top tier
너가 나를 다시 볼 수 있게
stay solid, like a rocky, speak foreign?
Imma bop it, 만약에 call it, stand right here
(매정한 시간이 먹는담 나이)
할 수 있나 rewind, 잡아줄 길이 될까 시간
나를 모른 척 하는게 또 다시 생각이 나지
이 공기 마저
(uh huh)
조금 멀어졌어도 okay, 널 찾을 수 있어 속에서
다른 사람과 손을 포개도
약속한 것처럼 만나 끝에서
널 만나기전까지의 wait, 십몇년은 돌았지 계속
원래 모든건 끝이 있대도
또 시작할 기회도 주어져 계속
그대로 있어 줘
나 닿지 못해도
멀리서도 볼 수 있게
누군 바보 같대
그래 바보 맞네
괜찮아 널 볼 수 있다면
약속했던 것처럼 right here

잊지 않았다면

다시 돌아와 줘요
지나간 일에 미련을 갖고
다시 돌아보는 것도 웃기잖아

현실은 야속하게 흘러 만가
잊은 것처럼 사람을 만났고
이유도 없던 것처럼 보냈어

'Wow hey it's been forever 
do you wanna get drink like together?'
I say 'I'm kinda busy but like stay in touch'

But by then I'll be far away uh 
and oh shit you lost the break up"

Your coffee to go is hotter than Hades
Some people line up to see a Mercedes
Call it a car, then call it a lady
What'll it be?

Time won't take nothing
Believe me, it's you that takes the time
Tell me if what makes you someone is something
Then why can't I have mine?
I've waited so long

Take it again, edit thе face
Love what you see, copy and paste
Isn't it magic? Don't you want to havе it
And say it's all mine? (That's mine)
Compile the content, you're filming a mosh pit
You ship it and box it right to your doorstep
Ain't it a wonder that we're going under

Tell me if what makes you someone is something

So defensive and it's you that its hurting

Got my hopes up now but I ain't got many no
I wanna die for someone
And find somebody to lose my head in
Nearly broke myself 'cause I got too selfish
Wanna fall in deep with a person I barely know
I wanna die for someone
Quiet I stay quiet
I got enough violence goin' on in my mind
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Guided I'm misguided
Wastin' my time with easy goodbyes
Ooh ooh ooh
I make memories
Got no one to share 'em with lately
'Cause nobody cares when you're lazy
Lazy with love (Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
I gotta find somebody to lose already
No I can't sit still because I'll get buried
Got my hopes up now but I ain't got many no
I wanna die for someone
And find somebody to lose my head in
Nearly broke myself 'cause I got too selfish
Wanna fall in deep with a person I barely know
I wanna die for someone
Die die die die for someone
Die die die die for someone
Die die die die for someone
I wanna die for someone"

How you gonna get there get there?
Always lookin' back and I don't know why
Something always there in the back of my mind
Everybody's livin' on a one way ride
How you gonna get there get there?

Every time I jump it's gettin' higher never ends

I would've never showed up
If I had known the blue skies

would have never meant so much

Baby the way you left me ruined everything
Yeah, baby the way you left me 
ruined everything
And everything and everything
Made me crazy 
how all the perfect times are turning 
into one bad dream
Baby the way you left me ruined everything
And everything and everything

Brings me back
Back to you
Stories that we wrote together
Moves so fast, gone too soon
Sometimes I wish I could
Rip out the pages, write a new ending
One with the lighter, shade of blue

If I had known that
Sunrise would have turned rain in the afternoon
I would've never showed up
If I had known the blue skies 
would have turned gray
Then the honeymoon

438,Wish You Were Here,CL,"Lately I've been thinking about us
Blowing smoke in the air listening to Stevie
Not enough uppers too many downers
Got my mind taking dares
And sleeping ain't easy
Cuz it's been 6 months since
I last saw you but I hope you're okay
Can't believe you went from mother
To angel in the space of a day
Cant help but wonder
What does your life look like
Without me there?
Without me there?
Do I still cross your mind
Without me there?
Without me there?
Is heaven all we thought it'd be
Can you still hear my voice now
Are you watching down on me
When all I see is stars
What does your life look like
Without me there?
Wish you were here
Maybe I was too uptight
Remember when you would call
Just to say that you love me?
Honestly everything's alright
It's just me and my thoughts
Don't you worry bout a thing
And it might be late wherever
You're dreaming to the playlist we made
A bit of old school jazz and our favorite Stevie
I know some things don't change
But I still wonder
What does your life look like
Without me there?
Without me there?
Do I still cross your mind
Without me there?
Without me there?
Is heaven all we thought it'd be
Can you still hear my voice now
Are you watching down on me
When all I see is stars
What does your life look like
Without me there?
Wish you were here
흘러 버릴 시간 속 그댈 떠나보낼 마음이
영원히 난 없는걸요
Uh Uh
I've tried to move on
But I keep listening to the same songs
Just can't seem to give up on us
흘러 버릴 시간 속 그댈 떠나보낼 마음이
영원히 난 없는걸요
Uh Uh
I've tried to move on
But I keep listening to the same songs
Just can't seem to give up on us
What does your life look like
Without me there?
Without me there?
Do I still cross your mind
Without me there?
Without me there?
Is heaven all we thought it'd be
Can you still hear my voice now
Are you watching down on me
When all I see is stars
What does your life look like

439,The Happiest Girl,BLACKPINK,"Don't hold my hand 
Don't beg me back
Don't say that we'll make it through this
If I'm so beautiful then why

The doors we slammed
The plates we smashed
Echo with the sound of madness
I can't remember why we try

My heart only wants you
The moment you say no

But tonight I'll be the happiest girl in the world
You'll see like it doesn't matter
Tonight I'll be the happiest girl in the world
You'll see like it never happened

I can stop the tears if I want to
I can stop the tears if I want to
I can stop the tears if I want to

But tonight I'll be the happiest girl in the world
You'll see like it never happened

Don't make us saints 
We're wards of pain
The past and a perfect picture
There's no one else to blame this time

Don't change the truth 
We can't undo the high 
we chase steal the crash no
You're not the one, who gets to cry

My heart only wants you
The moment you say no

But tonight I'll be the happiest girl in the world
You'll see like it doesn't matter
Tonight I'll be the happiest girl in the world
You'll see like it never happened

I can stop the tears if I want to
I can stop the tears if I want to
I can stop the tears if I want to

But tonight I'll be the happiest girl in the world
You'll see like it never happened

All it takes is a smooth pop of a bottle top 
to fix a heart 
A broken heart baby

All it takes is a little rolling paper 
take us to the start
Go back to the start

But tonight I'll be the happiest girl in the world
You'll see like it doesn't matter
Tonight I'll be the happiest girl in the world
You'll see like it never happened

I can stop the tears if I want to
I can stop the tears if I want to
I can stop the tears if I want to

But tonight I'll be the happiest girl in the world
You'll see like it never happened"

I'm goin' out of my mind
And keep asking myself
If you're not with me
What does everything mean to me?
No matter what they say
I'll believe in my way
When you come back to me
I'll give you all my heart
I'll be with you
Till the end of eternity
I will be your only star
Shine on you like morning star
To be with you
I will make my destiny
I want you to be my love
You know you're my only one

Nobody else
Nobody else can understand
how much I love you
Nobody else
Nobody else
I want you to be the one
You're the only one
I'll be your love
I'm alone now
Can you feel my fear?
Still standing here I feel like a loner
Thinking of you
Makes me unafraid
Even if the world has been unfair to us
I'm crying in the dark
While I'm calling your name
If our story ends
What does everything mean to me?
Through pain and all the hurts
I'll keep going my way
Please remember this
You are deep in my heart
I'll be with you
Till the end of eternity
I will be your only star
Shine on you like morning star
To be with you
I will make my destiny
I want you to be my love
You know you're my only one
We will never ever be apart
I'm all yours forever
Can't nobody make me let you go

Cause the last time left me cold
When she left my house
She didn't even let me know
Nigga she ain't even leave me notes
Part of the reason I'm easily hurt
Part of the reason I'm leaving you first
Pardon that part of me give my apologies
I know that working on it never works
I'm sorry it's you but hey what should I do?
Be happy with lies? Or be sad with the truth?
Don't be ashamed you see love is a game
And I still want to play
I'm just too scared to lose
And I know you are too
I don't wanna fall in love

Getting under my skin
I got you open
Won't you pull me in (pull me in)
You pour it on me slipping into desire
Whatever happens, Feed The Fire

I want some more

Cuz nobody's perfect I know it

많은 것 같아

그래도 말이야 더는 걱정하지 말아

쉽게 꺼냈으면 해 난 말했으면 해
오늘이 무사히 지나가기를 나는 기도해
형들이 안 싸우기를 내가 너무 동경했던
그 자리에는 가시방석이 날 맞이했어

까마득해지도록 이 트라우마

더 이상 아니거든 알바 뛰는 신세
지독한 실패를 딛고 나서 바꾼 인생

오늘 울고 떠든 만큼 목도 잠기겠지
내가 너무 말이 많아서 미안해 근데

you ain't gotta go nowhere 
oh please don't go (don't go away)
its that song cry no lie 
조금만 더 있어 봐
너무 많이 마시지도 마 
천천히 좀 더 (좀 더)
날 똑바로 봐 its so hard 
feel like I am losing my mind

나 집에 갈 시간이

Dreaming of being somebody I never was before
And then some more

It's funny how the time flies
Running wild
We're given chances all to take
But never twice

Holding breath has never been easy
Sinking down to my past
I wish you'd see me

See me like I'm on TV
Singing my life like Stevie
I'm wondering what could've been
But where's the purpose or meaning?
Already green here

Okay I'm guessing that's just how it goes
A bad memory been a problem
The exact reason I record

말했잖아 울어도 돼 힘들어도 돼
포기해도 돼 안꾸며도 돼 just be yourself
너 있는 그대로 너에서 그대 로 갈게 있는 대로
louis 보다는 우리 
gucci 옷 왜 입어 굳이
balenciaga 보단 그냥 네 냄새가
네 향기가 내겐 오드뚜왈렛 no.5

Don't let it change you 
사랑도 사람도 변하지만 
Don't let it change you 
한동안 여운이 남겠지만 
기억이 찾아와 
어느새 너의 
모난 모습을 
둥글게 깎으려 해도 
이 꿈은 쉽게 잡히지는 않겠지만 
I'll love you the way you are"

꿈만 같았는데 정말 꿈이었나 봐
기적보다 황홀했던 나의 시선 끝에 세상
그곳의 너는 슬퍼 보였는데 왜일까

하루가 일 년처럼 뒤틀려 있는 시간
이별의 의미를 이제 이해 하나 봐
머리에 안개가 낀 듯이 너의 모습이 불투명해
마른 한숨을 내쉬며 그늘진 얼굴 쓸어내려
유연했던 입꼬리는 주저 없이 흘러내려
매일 밤 흐느끼겠지 추억의 무덤에서
우리가 주고받던 수많은 질문과 대답
시시콜콜한 농담 뒤에 이어질
웃음소리까지 그걸 어떻게 가슴에 묻어
길고 긴 꿈을 꾸었나 모든 게 낯설기만 해
너무 많은 감정을 네 옆에 두고 왔나 봐
긴 꿈을 꾸었나 쉽게 잊으라 하기엔

잘 보이려 입어본 재킷을 확 던져
한동안 또 괜찮다가도 
하루 이틀 지나면 결국 망가져

사람 감정 진짜 뭣 같아
오르락내리락 기분이 답답해
다 큰 어른같이 보이고 싶은데도
아직 애인가 봐 그게 잘 안돼

오고 가는 사람들 사이
시끄러운 소음을 뚫고 나온 너의 말 good bye
이럴 거면 차라리 더
못된 말로 하지
이게 더 잔인해

진짜 돌아버릴 것 같단 말이야

그게 더 아파

친구들 앞에서 la la la
홀로 집에 가는 길엔 cry
네가 웃으면 속이 타
오늘도 난 하염없이 lying

화장실은 오른쪽 흡연구역 깊은 곳
휘청이는 탈색모 전화를 돌려봐도
아무도 받지 않고 빌어먹을 청춘은
눈치 없는 발정에 작은 몸 하나 누일 곳 없어

Under the sky I'm half naked oooh oh oh oh
Under the stars I'm awaken to the sound of a firebird
Under the sky I'm half naked oooh oh oh oh
We started at the center
Tear of dancing hands in the wind
Restless burning up a cigarette
The boys are calling shotgun again
Hot blood like a hurricane
I hear the wind is trembling
Shake shaking like a tambourine
Crawlers running into our skin
Oooh oh oh oh
Under the stars I'm awaken to the sound of a firebird
Under the sky I'm half naked oooh oh oh oh"

526,Scared to Be Lonely,Martin Garrix(마틴 개릭스)CONNECT 아티스트,"It was great at the very start
Hands on each other
Couldn't stand to be far apart
Closer the better

Now we're picking fights
And slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why
Wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more

Is it just our bodies
Are we both losing our minds
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
Cause we're scared to be lonely
Do we need somebody
Just to feel like we're alright
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
Cause we're scared to be lonely

Too much time, losing track of us
Where was the real
Undefined, spiraling out of touch
Forgot how it feels

All the fucked up fights
And slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why
Wonder what for
It's like we keep coming back for more

Is it just our bodies
Are we both losing our minds
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
Cause we're scared to be lonely
Do we need somebody
Just to feel like we're alright
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
Cause we're scared to be lonely
Scared to be lonely

Even when we know it's wrong
Been somebody better for us all along
Tell me, how can we keep holding on
Holding on tonight
Cause we're scared to be lonely
Even when we know it's wrong
Been somebody better for us all along
Tell me, how can we keep holding on
Holding on tonight
Cause we're scared to be lonely

Is it just our bodies
Are we both losing our minds
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
Cause we're scared to be lonely

Scared to be lonely
Scared to be lonely
Scared to be lonely
Eh, eh, scared to be lonely"
527,Stitch Em Up,Frank Walker,"You crashed my car
I drank too much
We fought all night
'Bout you and I
And called it love
When you say goodbye
I'd had enough
But in the end
I keep comin' back to us
Can't we just remember all the good times
All the good times we had
Can't we just remember all the good times
So we don't hurt so bad
I don't wanna hate you but if I forget
I know it'll hurt a little less
Can't we just remember all the good times
And never make the same mistakes again
We'll never heal these scars
We'll never lose this love
We'll break each other's hearts
So we can stitch 'em up
We'll never heal these scars
We'll never lose this love
We'll break each other's hearts
So we can stitch 'em up
So we can stitch 'em up
Don't get upset
And block my calls
I'd come home late you'd yell
And I would punch the walls
And when I left you'd had enough
But in the end
You still miss the thought of us
Can't we just remember all the good times
All the good times we had
Can't we just remember all the good times
So we don't hurt so bad
I don't wanna hate you but if I forget
I know it'll hurt a little less
Can't we just remember all the good times
And never make the same mistakes again

짙은 초록의 색깔로 넌 내 하늘을 채우고
그리고 넌 작은 나의 맘의

사랑이란 느낌이 뭔지 궁금했는데
헷갈리진 않을까 혹시
그런 그때 누군가 내게 다정하게 말했지

ooh I'll risk it all to keep you safe
Close you're eyes and see it through

Mesmerized within a minute In dreams 
night and day
I can't shake off these feelings with you baby 
all I need is you
There's nobody else girl you know it's true
Just hop on my jet tonight

In the sky, we'll chase the stars
No looking back, we've come this far
Hold my hand and we will find
A love so deep, it's one of a kind

Underneath the city lights tonight
We'll lose ourselves in love's delight
Together girl, we'll touch the sky
In this moment, we'll redefine

Ooh we'll riding through the fire we make
higher than a blue moon
ooh I'll risk it all to keep you safe
Close you're eyes and see it through

Mesmerized within a minute In dreams

I can't shake off these feelings with you baby 
all I need is you
There's nobody else girl you know it's true

I let it sit
Pit in my stomach
Know it's something
But don't know what it is

I started walking
Around the room
I fold my laundry
Make some coffee
I don't know what to do

Because
Without you
I'm a mess

Honestly I
Should probably just
Go back to bed

I'm unalive
When you're not here with me
I'm unalive
Til you say you miss me
All of the stars
Go out
When you're around
And shoot across the sky
But I'm unalive
When you're not here with me
When you're not here

Go to a party
Don't stay too long
Nobodies funny
Like you're funny
So I'd rather go home

Tried making dinner
Threw it away
I don't get hungry
When I'm lonely
And it don't taste the same

Because
Without you
I'm a mess

Honestly I
Should probably just
Go back to bed

I'm unalive
When you're not here with me
I'm unalive
Til you say you miss me

Empty's left behind the morning after
The distant purr of cars on soaking roads
And the street echoes the noise of laughter
The bottom of the bottle
Finds you almost every night

Thinking that's your only option
But you can flip the switch
And brighten up your darkest day
Sun is up and the color's blinding

Leave behind your narrow mind

Come alive come alive
Go and light your light let it burn so bright
Reaching up to the sky
And it's open wide you're electrified
When the world becomes a fantasy
And you're more than you could ever be

With your eyes wide open
And you know you can't go back again
To the world that you were living in
'Cause you're dreaming
With your eyes wide open
So come alive
Oh ah yeah
I see it in your eyes
You believe that lie that you need
To hide your face
Afraid to step outside
So you lock the door
But don't you stay that way
No more living in those shadows
You and me we know how that goes
'Cause once you see it all
You'll never never be the same
Little bit of lightnin' striking
Bottle up to keep on shining
'Cause you can prove there's more to you
You cannot be afraid
Come alive come alive
Go and light your light let it burn so bright
Reaching up to the sky
And it's open wide you're electrified
When the world becomes a fantasy
And you're more than you could ever be

For a way to break free

Painting a picture
Of what could be in my mind

Can't remember what I said
But I bet it wasn’t cool 
(Bet It wasn't cool)
I was close to death with you in that perfect dress
Knowing that it's heart or head
And breaking all the rules 
(Breaking all the rules)
Just like don’t fall in love 
before I know your name
Holding out hoping that you feel the same
No I've never been one for sounding cliche
But it's true


All I do is think about you
All I do is think about you
All I do is think about how
Your leap of faith made me
Put all my faith in you
So all I do is think about

No regrets, not even thе nights we spent
Finding out what patiencе meant
Holding up a mirror to myself
Learning to reflect
Because love like this doesn't come round all the time
And letting you get away would be a crime
‘Cause half of your heart
makes a whole out of this heart of mine



Uuuhh, all I do is think about you
All I do is think about you
All I do is think about how
Your leap of faith made me
Put all my faith in you
So all I do is think about you 
(All I do is think about you)
All I do is think about you 
(All I do is think about you)
All I do is think about how
How long I can't wait 
until I say get to say I do
So all I do is think about how


All my friends talk about the night we met
Can't remember what I said
But it worked out beautiful


All I do is think about you 
(All I do is think about you)
All I do is think about you 
(All I do is think about you)
All I do is think about how
Your leap of faith 
made me put all my faith in you


So all I do is think about you 
(All I do is think about you)
All I do is think about you
 (All I do is think about you)
All I do is think about how
How long I can't wait
 until I say get to say I do

631,Tears of Gold,Faouzia,"Mama always told me
That I was too naive
Gave away my trust for pennies
I said don't you worry

All you do is come around
Just came here to collect

Collect my pennies and my dimes
That's why you love it when I cry
Platinum love for you

So I'm broke and
Your heart's rich because of me
Know that this is my fault
Gave a little too much
Knew that this was gonna happen

I know I can't fight the sad days and bad nights

Into the arms of yours

About our own nature in love

Who knows how to play with the gods
You got nerves but they never show
Unless they hurt so you blamed it all
On my love the moving

at the party
Or is everybody fine
where they are (without me)

that I’m the only one not there

Do I hate missing out?
Or hate the thought of you not missing me
missing me

See it still when I close my eyes
I go back to those summer nights
Driving fast down a dead end road
Staying out past the afterglow

Now you’re laughing with someone new
Doing things that we used to do
Now I’m someone you used to know
The outsider
Of an inside joke

So hard not to notice
When you’re not around
Caught up in a memory
And I can’t come down

And nobody warned me
How bad it would haunt me to
See you so happy
Out on your own
Do I hate missing out?
Or hate the thought of you not missing me
missing me


See it still when I close my eyes
I go back to those summer nights
Driving fast down a dead end road
Staying out past the afterglow

Now you’re laughing with someone new
Doing things that we used to do

Is the joke on me
Was I the only one that
Didn’t see it coming

all we need is magic
But the misdirection followed the miles

Not gonna let you walk away
Without saying your sorry
Without saying your sorry
I'm not

Well you win one, and then you lose 'em
And you can tip toe around every problem
You gave hospitality to the pain
Just be man enough to say you were wrong
I don't expect you to change

Not gonna let you walk away
Without saying your sorry
Without saying your sorry
Oh, but I'm not gonna let you walk away
No, without saying your sorry"

On your face like you won
Like nothing that I say is gonna change
How you feel now
You sit there and you tell me you fell outta love
And we are in your way so you
Just gotta leave now
And we just need to understand your reasons
And you are gonna justify this treason
By telling me the promises
That we sworn ain't enough
So now you gonna be another person?
And how do I explain this shit to our son?
How'd you tell a toddler about a girlfriend?
Daddy's gone
Well I will be the strongest that he ever knew
And I will be there
When he needs a love strong enough
Don't worry I will carry your share for us
No matter how bad the storm
I will be strongest that he ever knew
And we'll leave you alone
You sit there with your phone
In your hands and you're hurt
You tell me that you feel like you lost me
When he came
I'm sorry but I cannot connect with your words
'Cause right now what matters isn't yours
But it is his name
And we just need to find another income
'Cause she wants you to help her
With her own one
And you want me to tell me that
What you've done is okay
So now you gonna be another father?
And I will be a different kind of mother?
And you'd tell a toddler 'bout step brothers?
Daddy's strayed
Well I will be the strongest that he ever knew
And I will be there
When he needs a love strong enough
Don't worry I will carry your share for us
No matter how bad the storm
I will be strongest that he ever knew
And we'll leave you alone
Let's talk about family
Let's talk about family
Let's talk of the ties and the lies
And the love that we had in this family
Let's talk about honesty
You know nothing about honesty
I'll let go of your hands and our plans
And the chance that we had with this family
Well I will be the strongest that he ever knew
And I will be there
When he needs a love strong enough
Don't worry I will carry your share for us
No matter how bad the storm
I will be strongest that he ever knew
And we'll leave you alone
Oh na na we'll leave you alone"

Sun up in the sky and I'm dressed for the weather

Friends are passing by, haven't seen in forever

Everybody's outside and I'm dressed for the weather

Waking up my sleepy head

Holding coffee in hand

Heading out without a plan

Left my phone on my bed

I don't know what happens next

All I know is that I'm feeling as fine as the day that I met her

Sun up in the sky and I'm dressed for the weather

Friends are passing by, haven't seen in forеver

Everybody's outside and I'm drеssed for the weather

Black top, white shoes

Got a million dollar view

Put on my hat and my rays

No one knows that they're fake

Put a smile on my face

All I know is that I'm feeling as fine as the day that I met her

Sun up in the sky and I'm dressed for the weather

Friends are passing by, haven't seen in forever

Everybody's outside and I'm dressed for the weather

Everything is just right

Wish that I could freeze it

As it rolls by, till the next time that I need

'Cause it's just right

Wish that I could freeze it

For the next time

You know

Feeling as fine as the day that I met her

Sun up in the sky and I've never felt better

Feeling as fine as the day that I met her

Sun up in the sky and I'm dressed for the weather

Friends are passing by, haven't seen in forever

Everybody's outside and I'm dressed for the weather

Come here with chances of hard rains
The skies were bluer yesterday
When you're screaming
and you slam the door
And you tell me that you need no more
Better know it'll all be okay
Sometimes it rains in LA
It looks like you'd arrived
And I'm soaked through to my brain
But that's alright
Won't let it drive me insane
Take my advice
Coming outside in the pouring rain
And let your feelings go
When you're dressed up very nice

When you think you got it right

When you feel like you're the boss

Bout those stupid texts and a fool I've been
Cause you got me blushing
Everytime I see you reply
Maybe It's too late
If you're seeing someone else

Everyday and everynight
Never seem like I'm your type
If you change your mind just call me right away
3 am and I really don't mind
If I gotta be your another backseat lover
Baby I've been waiting too long
And I'm writing this song just to tell you
I love you
Baby how you hangin'
You been acting weird and melting through your screen
Won't you tell me something
I thought you say you're the coolest guy
Maybe it's too late

Like a hummingbird that's singing

When your worries fill the air
You look outside your window
And there's a hundred shades of gray out there
But that's the moment I come in
With just another silly song
Here to remind you once again
That not everything is wrong
And if you feel lost
Close your eyes
Until you hear this small song playing
Following you
Through the miles
Like a hummingbird that's singing
Just for you
Sometimes a day might seem so long
So make it shorter with this song
We'll make the hours dance away
like a night at the ballet
Why'd you walk when you can dance around
You hear this tune all through the town
And the birds in the trees
Will be whistling its melody
Whistle its melody
And if you feel lost
Close your eyes
Until you hear this small song playing
Following you
Through the miles
Like a hummingbird that's singing
For you
For you
For you
I'll be singing just for you
For you
And you you
You you you
And if you feel lost

Wish that I was young

So I make friends with shadow

What am I supposed to do

'Cuz I know Peter Pan was right
Days feel like a blur now
Still feel eighteen but I'm burnt out
So I daydream of what I could be
If I turned back time
To a storyline
Where my mom read me a tale where
A couple kids one girl and a sailor
Met a boy in green
I thought it'd be me
But I guess that dream
Wasn't meant to be like
Oooh
Fairy tales are not the truth
What am I supposed to do

She traded makeshift gowns for serving rounds from sunrise till it's dark
And all her friends got someone to hold
And she's got no one else, still not prepared to make it on her own

And now the light in her eyes, it's now all but gone

So keep your head up
Yeah, keep your head up

One day you'll find your way back to the start
One day you'll live in your dreams
One day you'll wake up and girl you'll be a queen

So keep your head up princess 'fore your crown falls
Know these voices in your head will be your downfall
I know it gets so hard but you don't got far to go

And the path leads right to where they won't go

685,If the World Was Ending (feat. Julia Michaels),JP Saxe,"I was distracted
And in traffic
I didn't feel it
When the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin'
Were you out drinkin'?
Were you in the living room
Chillin' watchin' television?
It's been a year now
Think I've figured out how
How to let you go
And let communication die out
I know you know we know
You weren't down for forever and it's fine
I know you know we know
We weren't meant for each other and it's fine
But if the world was ending
You'd come over right?
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it?
All our fears would be irrelevant
If the world was ending
You'd come over right?
The sky'd be falling and I'd hold you tight
And there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye
If the world was ending
You'd come over right?
Right?
If the world was ending
You'd come over right?
Right?
I tried to imagine
Your reaction
It didn't scare me
When the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin'
That night we went drinkin'
Stumbled in the house
And didn't make it past the kitchen
Ah it's been a year now
Think I've figured out how
How to think about you without it
Rippin' my heart out
I know you know we know
You weren't down for forever and it's fine
I know you know we know
We weren't meant for each other and it's fine
But if the world was ending
You'd come over right?
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it?
All our fears would be irrelevant

You'd come over right?

No there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye

Sunshine through them fiery gems

With two cats in the yard
Life used to be so hard
Now everything is easy cause of you

Or find ourselves on Melrose Avenue?

I tried to reassure the waiter
Say you're down the street
He laughed at me

The most beautiful thing

Something about what love means to me
Maybe it's just circumstance

How do I feel so bad for how bad you hurt me now?
You convinced me that I stabbed myself in the back
Even though I can't reach the handle
Baby, if I struck a match, it would burn the whole place down
All this air's so gaslit, I can smell the toxins now
You throw pictures at the wall, and then leave me with the mess
And then act like all this is normal


I'm done sweeping glass and fixing frames
I'm done telling myself that you could change for me
Oh-ooh, oh-oh, yeah, I won't be the puppet on your string




Oh, the puppet on your string
Hmm, the puppet on your string


Paint me as the culprit and you frame me for your crime
Make me think the words you said are made up in my mind
Keep me in the dark 'til your intentions come to the light
And then say I just had my eyes closed

I know the rules
I'm never gonna win your game
It's time to say that


I'm done sweeping glass and fixing frames
I'm done telling myself that you could change for me
Oh-ooh, oh-oh, yeah, I won't be the puppet on your string

 Just a face they'll never know

 The ocean's deep as the sky is tall

 But you make me feel like I'm someone, you do
 'Cause I know I'm someone to
 You make me feel like I matter, you do
 'Cause I know I matter to you

 I hate busy parties
 All the music's way too loud
 Feel like nobody can see me
 But you hold me in the crowd

 And for a moment
 I feel better being there
 Like I'm somebody important
 Just because I know you care

She's having a sly indoor smoke,
She calls the folks 
who run this her oldest friends,
Sipping her drink and 
laughing at imaginary jokes
As all the signals are sent
Her eyes invite you to approach

That you just swallowed have got you going

You say I gotta get over you
And get sober too
I got a lot of habits I gotta kick
But weigh out all your options
And take your pick

I can either burn the bar down
Or I can take your number out my phone
I can give you up right now
Never want you back long as I'm half stoned
If you want me to quit you
Want me to get you out of my heart and baby off my mind
I hate to tell ya girl
But I'm only quitting one thing at a time

I know I got me some problems
About a thousand memories I gotta forget
But if I'm gonna solve 'em
Baby I'll take all the help I can get
If you ain't gonna kiss me
Then I'll take some whiskey
Some grizzly
Nicotine amphetamines too
You want me to stop some of that
Or you want me to stop loving you
Hey whatchu want me to do

I can either burn the bar down
Or I can take your number out my phone
I can give you up right now
Never want you back long as I'm half stoned
If you want me to quit you
Want me to get you out of my heart and baby off my mind
I hate to tell ya girl
But I'm only quitting one thing at a time
Aw yeah I hate to tell you
Aw yeah I hate to tell you

I ain't no superman
I'm just the way I am
If I'm gonna move on
Then I need me something in my hand
Ain't nothing wrong with that
If you ain't coming back

I can either burn the bar down
Or I can take your number out my phone
I can give you up right now
Never want you back long as I'm half stoned

For one more night no sleep
Tomorrow's wake up scene
Is starting right here
She had it out for me
For what we'll always be
Some type of in-between
We're keeping unclear
Oh nobody knows us like we do
A couple psychos
Back and forth through the cycles
Burn me up when you TYCO
Never goodbye for too long
A couple psychos
Back and forth through the cycles
Burn me up when you TYCO
Never goodbye for too long
Look I'm sorry bout the mood swings
Sorry bout the bad times
Sorry bout the good things
That we can't let go of
Never have enough
Standing by the fire
Of that butterfly love
We're flipping on a one way
Laying on a long track
Hanging out a window
Knowing that we could crash
Forget all the facts
For one more night with you
A couple psychos
Back and forth through the cycles
Burn me up when you TYCO
Never goodbye for too long
A couple psychos
Back and forth through the cycles
Burn me up when you TYCO
Never goodbye for too long
No nobody knows us like we do
No nobody knows the truth"

I watch it unfold from the back
Evan is walking the horizon
He slips on by we stifle laughs
I wonder why you've not the courage
Haven't you conquered half the land
Defer to healers when you're hurting
Cast off the one you call your man
Again again and over again
It gets harder and harder
And harder to just breathe
It's harder and harder and harder to be me
When I find myself squared up
In your vision your vision
Oh it's harder and harder
And harder to just breathe
It's harder and harder and harder to be me
When I find that we're closing up
The distance Between us
The distance between us
You call it merely your attraction
I beg to differ if I may
Let's keep it hidden all these feelings
I wouldn't have it any other way
So don't start talking around
It gets harder and harder
And harder to just breathe

i don't know when but i know how
well waste the daylight
and drive that dusk into the ground
all we ever had on paper
was a wild imagination
all we ever had to wager
was my wild human nature

it takes fire to find the weakness
i know you know
old horizons fall to pieces
a burning gravesite
i don't know them but i know how
i could erase mine
turn my condition upside down
all we ever had on paper
was a wild imagination
all we ever had to wager
was my wild human nature
i know you know
it takes fire to find the weakness
i know you know
old horizons fall to pieces
you gave me more than the world
and i gave up on my word
a lifetime lost in a day
when you dug up all the dirt
i never meant it to hurt
the former caused us to fray

First slow dance still hoping to get it right
I want you to know
A lonely heart it never can show
Take me back a need in your eyes
Baby come a little closer we'll be alright
One chance
No regrets
I swore to you a promise I'd never forget
Take me home I'm ready to fight
This time I know that I'll get it right
Straight talk where we begin
Go for broke
Shut it down and we'll do it again
So take it off you got the touch
Don't it feel like heaven?
No it's never too much
You hunger for paradise
So you trade hollywood
For those miami nights
How long it's a mystery
Your mind is made up
And you wanna believe
You still searching for emotion
You're holding on that feeling
Since the day it was broken
Take me home I'm ready to fight
This time I know that I'll get it right
Straight talk where we begin
Go for broke
Shut it down and we'll do it again
We'll do it again
Taken gets harder to admit
Shakin' why don't you let me quit?
Breaking coming back
Way down low
Feels like years since we ran the show
Take me home
I'm ready to fight
This time I know that I'll get it right
Straight talk where we begin
Go for broke
Shut it down and we'll do it again
Take me home
I'm ready to fight
This time I know that I'll get it right
Straight talk where we begin
Go for broke
Shut it down and we'll do it again

Is I get so high
I can't hide
The sun keeps creeping in
I'm sinking in
I'll stay inside

I don't wanna be a loner
Left alone
Don't wanna be the one
Hanging on the phone
But there I go
I can't stop

The trouble with this bed is I
And I can barely sleep at night
The trouble with this bed is
The trouble with this bed is
That I'm the only one in it
I'm the only one in it
I'm the only one in it

I feel your gravity
Close to me holding me
Down
Looking for signs of life
Feeling more alien
Oh there I go again

I don't wanna be a loner
Left alone
Don't wanna be the one
Hanging on the phone
But there I go
I can't stop

That I'm the only one in it
I'm the only one in it
I'm the only one in it
I'm the only one in it

I can feel the universe from my room
Pulling me away when I needed you
Laying in the dark letting you in
Holding you close under my skin
Morrissey t-shirt tell me how soon
Spinning in circles playing your tunes
In my head
In my head

But just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)
It's me hi
I'm the problem it's me
At teatime everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun
But never in the mirror
It must be exhausting
Always rooting for the anti hero
Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out
Slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart but never killed
Did you hear my covert narcissism
I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
(A tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)
It's me hi
I'm the problem it's me
(I'm the problem it's me)
At teatime everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun
But never in the mirror
It must be exhausting
Always rooting for the anti hero
I have this dream my daughter in law kills me
For the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers around and reads it
And then someone screams out
'She's laughing up at us from hell'
It's me hi
I'm the problem it's me
It's me hi
I'm the problem it's me
It's me hi
Everybody agrees everybody agrees
It's me hi (Hi)
I'm the problem it's me (I'm the problem it's me)
At teatime (Teatime)
Everybody agrees (Everybody agrees)
I'll stare directly at the sun
But never in the mirror
It must be exhausting
Always rooting for the anti hero"

You’re slipping through my fingertips
A little bit by a little bit
I didn’t know that loving you was
the happiest I’ve ever been
So I’m just trying to hold on
I need to learn how to cope without you
I'm tryna protect myself
but only you know how to
Yeah ohh I know what

Kinda hope you're following me out

Knees weak but you talk pretty proud wow
Ripped jeans and
A cup that you just downed
Take me where the music ain't too loud
Trade drinks but you don't even know her
Save me 'till the party is over
Kiss me in the seat of your Rover
Real sweet but I wish you were sober

Wish you were sober)
I wish you were sober

Wish you were sober)
I wish you were sober
Tripped on the road walking home
You kissed me at you door
Pulling me close begging me to stay over
But I'm over this rollercoaster
I'ma crawl outta the window now
Getting good at saying gotta bounce
Honestly you always let me down
And I know I'm not just hanging out
19 but you act 25 now
Knees weak but you talk pretty proud wow

Take me where the music ain't too loud

Hurt me with the word goodbye
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side

Is it a lie worth telling if it's about me

But still you say you love somebody else
Put my lovin on the shelf

You wanna be with me now
Tell me how it feels to be lovin' on a rebound
Baby let's just beee real
You wanna be with me now
Tell me how it feels to be lovin on a rebound

More than you were giving

You say you weren't ready to settle down
So I let you fly
So why when I'm looking at you now
You're somebody else's guy
Tell me was it something that I says to you
Or was I just too good for you
Or was I just too
Was I just too
So tell me what I did to you
Don't you know that I would live for you
And it's hard for me to hide from you
Cause you know that I would die for you
Tell me if it's
Something that I did
Cause I know damn well
She ain't got shit on me
So tell me if it's something that I
Something I was missing
When you are down
I'm down to listen
Baby I was committed
You don't know how it feels

치울 엄두조차 나질 않고
침대 위에 누워
얼마나 잘 수 있나 생각해

이리저리 부딪히며
마음대로 무엇 하나 되지 않는 하룰
견뎌내고 있잖아
다시 하루는 시작되고
숨 쉴 틈 없이 세상은 돌아만 가
하루 종일 모두 떼굴떼굴 굴러
이대론 안 될 것만 같아

눈만 깜빡였을 뿐인데
온데간데없어진 달
기지갤 피고 하품할 시간
조차 부족한데
부대낀 사람들
어딜 봐도 여유는 하나 없고
시곗바늘에 쫓겨
뭔가에 홀린 듯한 발걸음

뒤돌아봐 생각보다
날이 좋았는데
얼마나 많이 놓쳤을까
무감각함에 잠긴 것 같아
여행 가고 싶어
꿈을 꾸고 싶어
하늘을 보고 싶어
닫힌 내 마음을 움직이게 해준 바람
아침 햇살에 눈이 부셔
포근한 구름 위를 뒹구는 기분
너도 나도 이젠 하루하루 달라
내일은 어떤 날이 올까
우릴 위해 있는 거야 이 모든 게"

마음 깊이 널 사랑하고 애정 했는데
많이 아팠을까 너를 보내던 그 날
한숨뿐이던 나를 안아주었던 너에게

덜 익은 단풍 아래 시시콜콜한 농담도 참
웃음뿐이었는데
그땐 그랬는데 원래 그런가 봐서
소중한 너를 잊기도 더 쉬웠는데
참 오랜만이야 나 혼자 여길 서성이다
네가 있던 그 길을 상상해 너에게
작은 소리로 귓속말하던 너
내 말 한마디에 너의 무거웠던 표정
어느 순간 하나도 지울 게 없었던
어른이 되어 버린 그때의 어린 소년
입김이 짙어지고 다시 흐릿해지면
전부 다 사라지면

is it just me or do you feel it too
dream about a late night
red sky

I don’t wanna wake up

맘이 가는 대로 어디든 떠나볼까

Cause baby it is SUMMER SUMMER
저 태양도 잠들지를 못하네
Cause baby I'm a THUNDER THUNDER

찬 바닷물에 발 담그고
Cause baby it is SUMMER SUMMER
Yeah baby we are hotter than the SUN

이런 얘긴 좀 부끄럽지만 네가 있어 좋아
원하는 건 오직 단 하나
가끔 이렇게 함께 떠나자
그게 어디든 좋아 변치 말자
약속해 I’m with you

I could make it better
I could hold you tighter

초대받지 못한
환영받지 못한
나를 알아줬던 단 한 사람

내게 아침을 선물한 건 너야

내 여정의 답인 걸

좀 더 단단해진 목소리에
모든 건 네게 돌아가기 위해
이제 너라는 지도를 활짝 펼칠게

날 봐 왜 못 알아봐
남들의 아우성 따위 나 듣고 싶지 않아
너의 향기는 여전히 나를 꿰뚫어 무너뜨려
되돌아가자 그때로

I can make it better
I can hold you tighter
그 모든 길은 널
향한 거야

Oh oh
I can make it right
All right
All right
Oh I can make it right
All right
All right
Oh I can make it right
여전히 아름다운 너
그날의 그때처럼 말없이 그냥 날 안아줘
지옥에서 내가 살아 남은 건
날 위했던 게 아닌 되려 너를 위한 거란 걸
안다면 주저 말고 Please save my life
너 없이 헤쳐왔던 사막 위는 목말라
그러니 어서 빨리 날 잡아줘
너 없는 바다는 결국 사막과
같을 거란 걸 알아
All right
I can make it better
I can hold you tighter
Oh I can make it right
다 소용없었어

저 같은 날의 노래를
I believe 우연한 사랑을 찾았던
나를 지켜보고 있었지 (보고 있었지)
언제나 만날 수 있었던 곳에서
너를 기다리고 있어
복잡한 세상 속에 갇힌 채
손이 닿지 않아 난 두려웠어
하지만 계속 가도 되겠지
새로운 나날의 시작으로
I need you 언제나 내 곁에 있어 줘
나를 놓치지 말아줘
까만 밤 내 안에 펼쳐진 세계로
꿈은 반짝이고 있어
I believe 우연한 사랑을 찾았던
나를 지켜보고 있었지 (보고 있었지)
언제나 만날 수 있었던 곳에서
너를 기다리고 있어
어디론가 그렇게 흘러가지

짙은 별빛에 눈을 감고
너와 밤이 다 가도록

다른 온도와 다른 공간
딱 좋아 너무 빠르지도
느리지도 않아 붐바야
해변에 딴 이름은 지울 거니까
내 목소리만 담아줘 
밤에는 위험하게 모닥불을 피울 거니까
내 손을 잡고 날아가 줘

이 도신 따분하고 재미없어
요즘 내게 봄은 없었고 겨울만 길었어

입꼬리가 올라가지 하늘에 닿을 듯이
가만히 있지 못해 리듬 타는 발끝이

Thinking that there was more
I would have to lose
Maybe I was afraid
Letting go of all
Tied to one place
I confess, I was a bit selfish
Protective of our space
I guess maybe I just expected
This to go away
A house is only sticks and stones
That's what I've come to know
Some on the go
Find peace out on the road
But that don't mean that they're alone
As we reside
On borrowed time
The truth I'll hold
Was always you that made it home
You're what made it home
Maybe I always knew
That there would come a day
We'd have to start anew
I thought if I kept it out of mind
I'd never have to say goodbye
Like out of sight
Would make it easy to leave behind
I confess, I felt a bit helpless
Like it was my problem to save
In hindsight, I guess I rejected
Things would have to change
A house is only sticks and stones
That's what I've come to know
Some on the go
Find peace out on the road
But that don't mean that they're alone
As we reside
On borrowed time
The truth I'll hold
Was always you that made it home
What we have written in memory
Doesn't belong to any street
I'll keep it safe with me
Forever it holds a residence
Cul-de-sac home inside my head
That's how it'll be for me
Cuz now I see that
A house is only sticks and stones
That's what I've come to know
Some on the go
Find peace out on the road
But that don't mean that they're alone
As we reside
On borrowed time
The truth I'll hold
Was always you that made it home
You're what made it home home
You're what made it home
Maybe what they say is true
There really are some things
You're never gonna lose"

937,Heavenly Kind Of State Of Mind,Lewis Capaldi,"It's almost cruel, the blue in your eyes
The kind of blasphemy that makes a congregation cry
When I'm with you, it's like nothing else
Like I could run and tell the devil to go fuck himself

Oh Lord, I ain't afraid to die
If it means I'm by your side
It would be such a heavenly way to say goodbye
From now until the afterlife
Be it rain or hail or shine
We could be intertwined

Whether you were heaven-sent to save me from above
Or the only one who doesn't hate me, that's enough
When I need someone to save me from original sin
You call me like a chorus only angels could sing
Now, I think about you all of the time
Oh, what a heavenly kind of state of mind

You bring me peace that I'd never find
There's only chaos when I'm left here to my own device
To tell the truth, I think you saved my life
Giving my heart over to you would be no sacrifice

Oh Lord, I ain't afraid to die
If it means I'm by your side
It would be such a heavenly way to say goodbye
From now until the afterlife
Be it rain or hail or shine
We could be intertwined

Whether you were heaven-sent to save me from above
Or the only one who doesn't hate me, that's enough
When I need someone to save me from original sin
You call me like a chorus, only angels could sing
Now, I think about you all of the time
Oh, what a heavenly kind of state of mind

And I feel the rapture
When I'm looking at ya
Oh, what a heavenly kind of state of mind
You're the only reason
That I keep believing
Oh, what a heavenly kind

Darling, you were heaven-sent to save me from above
You're the only one who doesn't hate me, that's enough
When I need someone to save me from original sin
You call me like a chorus, only angels could sing
Now, I think about you all of the time
Oh, what a heavenly kind of state of mind

And I feel the rapture
When I'm looking at ya
Oh, what a heavenly kind of state of mind
You're the only reason

Oh, what a heavenly kind of state of mind"

In the violet sky 

And it looks so pretty

I sit alone 

In the candlelight

It's alright 

Ooooooooo 

You do yours and I'll do mine 

I'm in the pool 

In the pouring rain 

I stick my tongue into the tip of the daisy chain 

I took your phone 

In a drunken state 

I think it's funny 
when you're too annoyed to concentrate  

You know it's so, so scary 

When you see me for what I truly am 

You know its so, so scary 

When you look right at me

Hey are you really livin'?
The older you get
The deeper you feel it
Pretend to be brave
And cover your feelings
But they lose their place
And you let all the fear end
And slowly erase
That beautiful dreamin'
Forget where you came from
And how far you're going
Forget how to play fun
The more that you're growing
And if you never give up then
All will be well
But you gotta fight for it
You really gotta try for it
'Cause nobody knows you
Like you know yourself
Nobody needs you

Nobody hurts you

943,backseat driving,joan,"Past life, I'm thinking 'bout a past life
Good times, we used to have some good times

[Pre-Chorus]
Should we just start over?
Should we hit the brakes?

[Chorus]
You got me swerving between the lanes
And now I'm closing my eyes and accelerating
Oh, there's only so much I can take with all this
Backseat driving



[Verse 2]
Crossfire, we're caught up in the crossfire
Cloudy skies, got me thinking 'bout the last time

[Pre-Chorus]
We said we should start over
Instead of hitting the brakes

[Chorus]
You got me swеrving between the lanes
And now I'm closing my еyes and accelerating
Oh, there's only so much I can take with all this
Backseat driving
We're breaking down and this car is crashed
And we were ignoring all the signs we passed
And now there's no way that we can turn back with all this
Backseat driving

[Bridge]
Got me turning the wrong way
Over the bridge in the lake
Feels like you are miles away
With all this backseat driving
Breaking down and car is crashed
Ignored all the signs we've passed
Now there's no way we'll go back
With all this backseat driving


[Chorus]
You got me swerving between the lanes
And now I'm closing my eyes and accelerating
Oh, there's only so much I can take with all this
Backseat driving
We're breaking down and this car is crashed
And we were ignoring all the signs we passed
And now there's no way that we can turn back with all this
Backseat driving

Got me turning the wrong way
Over the bridge in the lake (turning the wrong way)
Feels like you are miles away
With all this backseat driving"
944,Thorns,Yum Yuck,"My days are always strange
They change faces and slip away
But I don't mind no I don't mind
Cause the night can still be kind
Another close shave with a dull blade
Yeah she really likes to see my face
So I take time and I take pride
I keep the razor by my side
She only comes out when it's raining
She's always hiding the pain away
It's just her way
My heart could clot
If you choke it up enough
And don't despair all the rituals and fanfare
My sunken thoughts my cabin built from thorns
The moon is high but the river's running dry
She only comes out when it's raining
She's always hiding the pain away
It's just her way
But don't you weep or turn the other cheek
Just think of me when you look outside
and it's raining"
946,Rather Be Happy (feat. hazel),Braaten,"Looking at the pictures of us from before
Doing all the things we don't do anymore
Though we both made mistakes
Seems like I am the one who pays
You used to feel like home
Staying up for hours
Always wanting more
Now instead of crying from laughing too much
The tears in my eyes are there because
Cause I remember you would shiver
When I called your name
And every inch of me was so in love
How did we change
So I'd do anything to make you want me
Now I see
I'd rather be happy
Ra-ra-ra, Ra-ra-ra
Rather be happy
Ra-ra-ra, Ra-ra-ra
Rather be happy
Ra-ra-ra, Ra-ra-ra
Rather be happy
I'd rather be happy
Ra-ra-ra, Ra-ra-ra
Rather be happy
I don't wanna leave
Don't wanna walk away
Cause when I picture you with someone else
My heart breaks
I wish I could stay
But we ran out of things to say
Oh, yeah
When I'm waking up beside
It's like you're not there
And when we kissing
Oh, I'm missing how it used to taste
And it hurts so much to look at all we lost
Tell me how did we get here
Cause I remember you would shiver
When I called your name
And every inch of me was so in love
How did we change
So I'd do anything to make you want me
Now I see
I'd rather be happy
Ra-ra-ra, Ra-ra-ra
Rather be happy
Ra-ra-ra, Ra-ra-ra
Rather be happy

947,A Song About Me,Oscar Lang,"Well I tried
I swear to God I really tried
Well you cried
But I'd seen it from before behind your eyes
Now you ask me how am I feeling
Now I feel cut in half
I've become another person
Now it hurts when I laugh
'Cause it reminds me of your personality
Guess that I lied when I agreed
You said 'don't you write a song about me'
Well I know
Know you're listening now
And you're feeling sad
Well I hope
Yeah I hope one day
We can laugh about the past
You asked me how am I feeling
Now I feel cut in half
I've become another person
Now it hurts when I laugh
'Cause it reminds me of your personality
I guess that I lied when I agreed
You said 'don't you write a song about me'
This is a song to always remind me
Now I'm moving on
Now I'm moving on
We built up the walls
Then watch as they fall down
Now I'm moving on now
Now I'm moving on now
Now I'm moving on now
Now I'm moving on now
Now I'm moving on now
Now I'm moving on now

Tonight I'm ready to dive
Maybe it's the loving in your eyes

Maybe it's the fact that every time I fall
I lose it all

And nothing is wrong it's all right
I'm coming out and diving in tonight

Damn, I hope you don't leave alone, oh
If you don't, if you don't
You could stay


And talk with me for days
Over lousy coffee cake
We don't need to watch the time
Let everybody walk on by
And in another life
You wouldn't be a passerby
At any other breakfast place
Wherе people go their sеparate ways
Separate ways

[Verse 2]
Home alone now in my bedroom
Thinking of the flower tattoo on your neck
Did you know I noticed it?
Oh, guess we'll never tell each other stupid jokes
And all about what our parents do
All I got was a glimpse of you (Glimpse of you)


And talk with me for days
Over lousy coffee cake
We don't need to watch the time
Let everybody walk on by
And in another life
You wouldn't be a passerby
At any other breakfast place
Where people go their separate ways
Separate ways


Ooh-ooh
I think about it every day
Maybe you wouldn't stay
If you looked my way


You can talk with me for days
Over lousy coffee cake
We don't need to watch the time
Let everybody walk on by (Walk on by)
And in another life
You wouldn't be a passerby
At any other breakfast place
Where people go their separate ways

Separate ways
Where people go their separate ways"

 In your South West sheets, we could never fall out
 Yeah, going way-way back, as far as the sky
 With the ceiling back, the sun in your eyes
 Almost re-relapse, every time I drive by all those

 California palms and California sands
 The California palms of your California hands
 Wish I could be in love where the summer never ends
 In the California palms of your California hands"

Out of a tree
I saw the birds and the bees start
Laughing at me
I'm not a cat I can't just
Land on my feet
But damn that'd be sweet

Can't hop a fence
To save my life
I been a gym class disaster since '99
In my defense
I always try
But there's some heights you just can't climb

Nothing is harder
To get over
Than a tall boy
A tall boy

Nothing is harder
To get over
Than a tall boy
Than a tall boy

Tall tall tall

My type was 6.4
Sport shorts hitting their heads
On every normally sized door 
made them forget
To think about me busy sharing a bed
With a couple Sophie's instead

I can't hop a fence
To save my life
I been a gym class disaster since '99
In my defense
I always try
And despite all the heights I've climbed

Nothing is harder
To get over
Than a tall boy
A tall boy

Nothing is harder
To get over
Than a tall boy
Than a tall boy

Be careful falling for a tall boy
You'll be falling for a long time
For a tall boy

Up and down and stressed
I don't feel right
I guess it's just a sad boy summer (sad boy summer)
Yeah, just a sad boy summer (sad boy summer)
Tell you a secret
That nobody knows
Promise you'll keep it
I swear that I won't
And my social life is burning
I'm alone and hurting
Demons are returning
Now I'm googling, 'Depression'
Got in self-obsession
Searching for my blessing
But it's nowhere to find
Stayed calm and kept it patient
But inside I'm suffocating
So sick of fucking waiting
For my world to align
Yeah

Up and down and stressed
I don't feel right
I guess it's just a sad boy summer (sad boy summer)

Wasting all my tears
Tryna run dry
Is it me or just a sad boy summer?
Yeah, just a sad boy summer
I sell the others
Sweet little lies
Even my mother
I tell her I'm fine, yeah
I've become a stranger
Appetite for danger
Nothing I can change, yeah (change, yeah)

Burned in my brain

You taste like
Lemon and lime
So sweet baby 
it's such a crime sing me like a melody
Play me like a tambourine
Tell me were too young to think forever 
we'll be 23

Can we fade out into the night
Talk about all the things on your mind 
nothing but a memory
Falling into jealousy

I don't think you notice what you did to me

I miss your cough drops and sticky fingers
Late starts
Your Perfume lingers from last night

The feelings
Burned in my brain
Come on I know you feel the same
Listen
I know myself and I don't need convincing 
all I need is you in repetition
All night and every day
Come on I know you feel the same
Come on I know you feel the same way

You're a fever
It's making me sick
You're a vice that I can't quit
Smoke me like a cigarette
Never put you down again
Fill my lungs with you
Then stop my heart ‘cause I can't handle it

And now I'm on the fault-line
Just waiting for you to come by
Baby you left me behind
And I don't think you notice what you did to me

I miss your cough drops and sticky fingers
Late starts
Your Perfume lingers from last night

The feelings
Burned in my brain
Come on I know you feel the same

Listen
I know myself and I don't need convincing

It was probably for show
All the memories are blurry
So I let 'em burn slow
I ain't seen you in a minute
Where did all the time go?
You was out of pocket
When you told me die slow
I was going through the shits
I kept it down low

Likely they wanna fight me
Come on try it out try me
They put me down but I never cried out
Why me words from the wise
Don't put worth inside somebody
That ain't try
They said I wouldn't make it out alive
They told me I would never see the rise
That's why I gotta get 'em every time
Gotta watch 'em bleed too
Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathing
Racing to the moonlight and I'm speeding
i'm headed to the stars ready to go far
I'm star walkin'
Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathing
Racing to the moonlight and I'm speeding
i'm headed to the stars ready to go far
I'm star walkin'

995,Hero (feat. Christina Perri),Cash Cash(캐쉬 캐쉬),"I let my soul fall into you
I never thought I'd fall right through
I fell for every word you said
You made me feel I needed you
And forced my heart to think it's true
But I found I'm powerless with you

Now I don't need your wings to fly
No, I don't need a hand to hold in mine this time
You held me down, but I broke free
I found the love inside of me
Now I don't need a hero to survive
Cause I already saved my life
Cause I already saved my life

I fell into your fantasy
But that's all our love will ever be
I lost hope in saving you and me
You think I'm lost, falling apart
But your lies just made a stronger heart
My life is just about to start

Now I don't need your wings to fly
No, I don't need a hand to hold in mine this time
You held me down, but I broke free
I found the love inside of me
Now I don't need a hero to survive
Cause I already saved my life
Already saved my life
I already saved my life
Already saved my life

Now I'm tying us together
Tell myself I wouldn't feel things
If I labeled us whatever

Got me thinking it's been so long
Since I felt so fucking unwell
I've been losing sleep, I can't eat
I'm so weak, oh-oh, oh-oh (oh-oh, oh-oh)
I wasn't looking for this

997,Ballroom Extravaganza,DPR IAN,"The crowd has come to a halt
관객들은 멈춰있어
The birds won't sing for you anymore
새들은 너를 위해 더 이상 노래를 부르지 않아
Not like before
예전만큼은
When the trees are all burning
나무들이 다 불타고 있을 때
All the stars will keep on turning
별들은 모두 깜빡이고 있을 거고
And I know I won't stop searching
그리고 난 계속 찾을 거란 걸 알아
For the moment when the world
이 세상이 너를 위해
Stopped for you
멈췄을 때
It stopped for you
널 위해 멈췄을 때
Then the world came crashing down
그때 세상이 무너져 내렸지
And it's pulling you in now
이제 너를 끌어들이고 있어
You know all the words to the play
넌 각본의 모든 대사를 알지
But all I wanted was you to stay
하지만 난 네가 남아있길 원했을 뿐이야
Your time is running thin
너의 시간은 점점 사라져가
Cause I'm falling through
The cracks under your floor
왜냐면 나는 너의 발밑 땅 사이로 떨어지고 있어
How does it feel to be alive again?
다시금 살아있는 느낌이 어때?
Stop holding on with your dear breath
더 이상 숨을 참아가며 붙들고 있지 마
You're one step closer to me
넌 나에게 한 발짝 더 가까워져
On the ballroom extravaganza
화려한 댄스 파티에서
I know you won't find me anymore
넌 날 더 이상 찾지 않을 걸 알아
I tried to reach for you once more
다시 한번 더 너를 붙잡아 봤어
But the world came crashing to the ground
하지만 세상이 땅으로 무너져 내렸지
When the story comes to an end
이 이야기가 끝이 나면
Will it be the same again?
모든 게 다시 똑같을까?
When all the king's horsemen
And all the king's men
왕의 마부들과 왕의 모든 부하들이
They couldn't put you back together again
다시 너를 되돌릴 수 없을 때
Oh when the story comes to an end
이 이야기가 끝이 나면
Will it be the same again to you?
너에게는 똑같을까?
To you
너에게는
When the story comes to an end
이 이야기가 끝이 나면
Will you be the same again at all?
너는 똑같을까?
At all

1009,When I’m Alone,Post Malone(포스트 말론),"We made a pact you'd take me back
Always again
I'm bleedin' out I need you now
Can't let you win
I want it all I want it all
I push so hard I break it
My only home went down in smoke
It's bittersweet I taste it
So are you lonely? 'cause I'm healin' slowly
In a moment your memory is fading on me
Got no expectations now that I'm forsaken
Let's see what I'm made of
Find out if I can take it now
When I'm alone
Pretend I'm letting you go
Just tell me who to blame for this
When wakin' up
Feels like a punch in the gut
Just tell me who's to blame for this?
All I wanted was a piece of decent on the side
(On the side)
When we go to bed
She be creepin' on my side (On my side)
I was drinkin' all day I let her spend the night
When I took her home
She left somethin' in my ride in my ride (Damn)
Then my baby found out
Now I'm livin' in a hotel livin' in a hotel
Ain't that bad I got room service
Livin' in a hotel livin' in a hotel
What your life like? Need a lifeline right now
Ninety nine nights
Tryna get my mind right now
Life is sour even when I'm in the limelight now
But I try somehow
When I'm alone
Pretend I'm letting you go
Just tell me who to blame for this
When wakin' up
Feels like a punch in the gut
Just tell me who's to blame for this?
(Ta da da da ta da da da ta da da da)
Just tell me who's to blame for this?

Everybody lookin' for a dance floor to run on
If you wanna run away with me

Turn into a sunrise?
Kiss right through the night?

Hear the same in mine yeah

I could put a ring on your finger

1015,Night Changes,One Direction(원 디렉션)CONNECT 아티스트,"Going out tonight
Changes into something red
Her mother doesn’t like that kind of dress
Everything she never had she’s showing off

Driving too fast
Moon is breaking through her hair
She said it was something that she won’t forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

Were only getting older baby
And Ive been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you’ve ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there’s nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you

Chasing it tonight
Doubts are running round her head
He’s waiting, hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beating loud, she doesn’t want it to stop

Moving too fast
Moon is lighting up her skin
She’s falling, doesn’t even know it yet
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

Were only getting older baby
And Ive been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you’ve ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there’s nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you

Going out tonight
Changes into something red
Her mother doesn’t like that kind of dress
Reminds her of a missing piece 
Of innocence she lost

Were only getting older baby
And Ive been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you’ve ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there’s nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change, baby
It will never change, baby
It will never change me and you"

in our lives
East Anglian sky empty bottle of wine
I got you by my side talkin' 'bout love and life
Oh how lucky am I when I look in your eyes?
What a wonderful way
to spend a moment or two
To be lyin' awake and be here talkin' to you
I got somethin' to say I know what I gotta do
To be makin' a change
now the moment of truth
Why am I feeling so nervous when
Things are goin' so perfect? And
But I know that it's worth it to
Spend forever with you
And so I count to three
And get on one knee
And I ask you
Darling honestly
I've waited all this time
Just to make it right
So I'll ask you (Tonight)
Will you marry me? Just say yes
One word one love one life
A gentle touch of the hand fingers
runnin' through hair
Lips pressed to my lips oh I was caught unaware
Arms holdin' me tight tears in both of our eyes
What a beautiful way to spend
the rest of our lives
Sun will reappear burnin' auburn and red
My chest was the pillow
green grass lawn was the bed
Last night was the night
one last moment of truth
And what a wonderful way to fall
in deeper in you
Why was I feelin' nervous when
Things were going so perfect? And
Well now I know that it's worth it to
Spend forever with you
And so I count to three
And get on one knee
And I ask you
Darling honestly
I've waited all this time

But I still do
Cause you were my first
You were my last
You were my future

While I'm here with somebody
Doing nothing

The way that we left it
Would have such an influence on me
Wish I could turn back time


Oh I know it’s late and you hate that I do this
Maybe it’s foolish but....


I don’t wanna talk about us
I just wanna talk about how you’ve been lately
I don’t wanna get my hopes up
Thinking that we’ll ever be together someday
I don’t need anything from you
And I know it’s a little too soon
But you and I you and I you and I you and I loved once
And I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna see you


Oh I know it’s late and you hate that I do this

1045,grateful,Dhruv,"Heaven only knows I've been down
Couldn't see the sun behind the clouds
Wondered if it'd ever come out again
Snug inside the arms of loneliness
Nineteen candles out before we kissed
Nights of my youth hardly missed
But I say whoever wrote this story
crafted one hell of an arc
The bits of me I couldn't stand
are my favorite parts
Never used to take the time to recognize
Everything I need is right in my line of sight
And I don't know my destination
but I've come to learn
The universe gives you the answers
on it's own terms
Through the highs and through the lows
I look up to the sky
I know the world is mine
I feel so fucking grateful
I'm so so fucking grateful
We took the long way 'round
Been in the lost and found
I feel so fucking grateful
I'm just so fucking grateful
Yeah heaven really knows I overthink
Do a thousand takes and pick the fifth
Get overwhelmed by every little thing
(Little thing little thing)
Remember being a kid and wild and free
Playing Rapunzel from the balcony
Thinking I didn't care how you'd see me
Good day
Yeah we're sitting on a park bench
in the thick of spring
I write these words and watch the daffodils
sway in the wind
Never used to take the time to look around
Pay attention to the different layers of sound
It's so funny
how we run to where we need to be
That we never get to take in the scenery
I don't wanna live my life that way
I look up to the sky
I know the world is mine
I feel so fucking grateful
I'm so so fucking grateful
We took the long way 'round
Been in the lost and found
I feel so fucking grateful
I'm just so fucking grateful
Yeah I don't want this day to end
We watch the sun make its descent
I ask if you've got somewhere else to be
We talk into the dead of night
Share history in the dwindling light
And thank the stars for here is
where we've reached"

Tell me why I always gravitate to you
Can we navigate
Open up the gates
Come closer
I feel a type of way
And I can't keep my composure
Drifting towards me
We can slowly move
Further away from the start
Cause we know
We both can't control

Frustrated and bothered
Paranoid that you destroy my colour
And paint it cover it and fade it
Leave me looking jaded
How do I still love you when I hate this?
Got me keeping quiet
But you know I wanna talk about it
I don't wanna have to hide it
I need someone to confide in
Don't let me stow it away
'Cause I can barely fight it
It's a constant ache when i'm reminded that
You never call my telephone
But you know we're both alone
What is it you're holding on to?
Because there's something wrong
I understand that you may never want me close
But understand that.
I need you the most
I spread my love
Along your path so
Please tread softly
Please tell me you won't go stomping harshly
You don't have to want me
But please tread softly

Oh karma
Why do I even bother?
When you never wanna stick with me
Instead of choosing others to favour
You know I can't hate her
For watching him go chase her
Nothing he could do could ever phase her
Got me sick and tired
Of the faking and the lying
But god knows that i'm trying to stay
But she's denying that she ever fell in love
With the pages of his mind
But she didn't wanna be in his cages all the time
Forgive me if you find me replaying it in my head
You saying what you said
Words I wish I never read
'Cause I
I
I need you the most
I spread my love
Along your path so
Please tread softly
Please tell me you won't go stomping harshly
You don't have to want me
But please tread softly

Said you've got someone new, I didn't have a clue, but they say you're all right

You're still the one I want, but now I'm disabled

All that I have are prayers, prayers for you
All that I have are prayers, prayers for you

You wonder why I'm always getting stoned
'Cause baby when I'm low
You never come around
You tell me that you care
So tell me why you're always over there
And when I'm shining
You you're the thunder cloud
When I'm thriving you pull me under ground
You can break my heart I'm not broken
I can build a house
With the stones you're throwin'
I'm not a dreamer it ain't always greener
But I'll turn this pain into champagne
My head is always sore
It ain't even from the night before
Oh baby I'm so over getting hung over you
It's out of my control
When all you are is hypocritical
Oh when I'm your puppet you f**kin' love it
You can break my heart
I'm not broken
I can build a house with the stones you're throwin'
I'm not a dreamer it ain't always greener
But I'll turn this pain into champagne
Another maze and I made it out
I take the pain and I pour it out
You know there's nothing left to save me
But this champagne...

I'm not a dreamer it ain't always greener
But I'll turn this pain into champagne
You can break my heart I'm not broken
I can build a house with the stones you're throwin'
I'm not a dreamer it ain't always greener

Into the arms of yours
But I don't need a cure for me

About our own nature in love
The glorious teachers are no use for creatures
Who knows how to play with the gods
You got nerves but they never show
Unless they hurt so you blamed it all
On my love the moving

Victim of the great machine

I indulge in luxury
Everything I do is wrong

Hit the bong hit the b b b b b
Feel good
Feeling shitty in my bed
Didn't take my fuckin' meds
Hyperpop up in my ears
Everything just disappears

Wasting all my energy on someone

And it feels like I've just felt it all before

I wish that I could be a younger me
Clarity
A revelation we were meant to be

I'm still begging for more
Call the exorcist the hypnotist
They can't find a cure
It's goes on and on
We take we want we quit
And call it love
It goes on and on
I put my faith in you
A pill to crush
Sanity
I feel like I've been floating endlessly
Pray for me
Cuz I've been chasing wine with alchemy
I took everything they gave me
I'm still begging for more
Call the exorcist the hypnotist
They can't find a cure
It's goes on and on
We take we want we quit
And call it love
It goes on and on
I put my faith in you
A pill to crush
I wanted to tell you
Youth of a godless culture
God of a youthless cult
Cult of a passing stranger
Stranger than what I thought
Pockets full of flowers
Vanilla in your eyes
Sometimes the way you love me
Makes me cry
I took everything they gave me
I'm still begging for more
A pill to crush"

1086,she calls me daddy,KiNG MALA,"She's a little bit psycho
But she follows
When I call in the middle of the night
She's got you wrapped around her finger
You try to linger
But she's already on her way to mine

It might be a little superficial
She plays with the boys
But she comes home to me
Little fucked up but I think it's official
'Cause she might be your girl
But she's calling me daddy

She's mi-i-i-ine
She wears a collar with my name
Secretive but not ashamed
She's mi-i-i-ine
But I'd never tie her down
They always come around now

I'm a bit of an ice queen
Little bit mean
But my girl likes the way I shoot 'em down
Says she likes when I play king
Little play thing
Yeah my girl likes the way I wear my crown

You should see their face when they finally realize
That she plays with the boys
But she comes home to me
Want to change her mind but I think it unwise
'Cause she might be your girl
But she's calling me daddy

She's mi-i-i-ine
She wears a collar with my name
Secretive but not ashamed
She's mi-i-i-ine
But I'd never tie her down

Change her mind
It's impossible
Close your mouth you'll catch a fly
Watch the girl get what she likes"

So I'll say it once again, you've got me
Now it's easier to compromise
When you're seeing all the sides
But my vision's blurred, won't ever stop me
Melancholy, you've got me, you've got me
Now you've got me dragging the chain
Melancholy, you've got me, you've got me
Feels like I've got some blood on the brain
Hear me scream and shout
Caught in this roundabout
Tangled thoughts wrapped up in cotton thread
Didn't wanna leave my bed
Once again I've been mislead on my knees
Caught, stuck in all of this spider's web
But I know I'm just mislead
So I'll say it once again, you've got me
Now it's easier to compromise

1088,Float On,Phil Good,"(originally by Modest Mouse)

I backed my car into a cop car the other day
Well, he just drove off, sometimes life's okay
I ran my mouth off a bit too much, oh, what did I say?
Well, you just laughed it off and it was all okay

And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on anyway, well

A fake Jamaican took every last dime with that scam
It was worth it just to learn some sleight of hand
Bad news comes, don't you worry even when it lands
Good news will work its way to all them plans
We both got fired on exactly the same day
Well, we'll float on, good news is on the way
We'll float on, good news is on the way

And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on, alright

Already, we'll all float on, no don't
You worry, we'll all float on, alright
Already, we'll all float on, alright
Don't worry, we'll all float on

Already we'll all float on, alright

 Watch her take over your throne, bet you

I don't wanna be your friend
I don't wanna just pretend
Can't forget about the things that we had
You just wanna act like
You don't take a part of me
Every time you turn and leave
Hurts to say it
I don't want it to end
But I don't wanna be your friend


No it probably sounds too harsh
But I don't need another scar
I hate how you turn it on and off like a faucet
Now it's floodin and my mind's getting lost in
All the memories of feelin so еxhausted
And what could've been, I'm not over it, so


I don't wanna bе your friend
I don't wanna just pretend
Can't forget about the things that we had
You just wanna act like
You don't take a part of me
Every time you turn and leave
Hurts to say it
I can't do it again
Cause it


Starts off with small talk
Yeah it's always the same
Say you wanna start over
You don't really wanna hear me say this, but


I don't wanna be your friend
I don't wanna just pretend
Can't forget about the  things that we had
You just wanna act like
You don't take a part of me
Every time you turn and leave
Hurts to say it
I don't want it to end
But I don't wanna be your friend

I don't wanna second guess
What's going on inside your head
Playing back all the memories we had
You just wanna act like
You don't take a part of me
Every time you turn and leave
Hurts to say it
I don't want it to end
But I don't wanna be your friend


I don't wanna, wanna be your friend
I don't wanna, wanna be your friend"
1103,Something bout That Feeling,Devin Kennedy,"When it feels like 
I've been fading to the background
Don't leave my room for like a week, 
don't wanna go out
But all these moments 
keep me reminding me of just how
Just how you can't have the high's 
without the letdowns
I overcomplicate
I underestimate
How easy it is to live like this
Feel better if I take my time
Just a second and I'll be alright
I know that there's a love that's gonna find me
There's something 'bout that feeling
There's something 'bout that feeling
There's something 'bout that feeling
There's something 'bout that feeling
Outside, the rain's done dancing 
with the storm clouds
But inside, there's not a dry eye 
in this whole house
And it ain't sadness 
why these tears keep falling down now
I know I'm not alone, 
I just get caught up in myself
I overcomplicate
I underestimate
I know that there's a love that's gonna find me
There's something 'bout that feeling
There's something 'bout that feeling
There's something 'bout that feeling
There's something 'bout that feeling
There's something 'bout that feeling
There's something 'bout that feeling
There's something 'bout that feeling
There's something 'bout that feeling"

When we only cared about the fall
There was no way to know that we would give in now

And now we're stuck in holdin', everything is frozen
We fakin' safe and sound (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And when I can't keep pickin' up each time you call
If everything I say just tears us down

You're all that I want
You're all that I need
And if it hurts me then
I don't want it
You're all that I want
You're all that I need
And if it hurts me then
I don't want it

[Verse 2: Troye Sivan]
I'm learnin', baby, if we keep on burnin'
No, I can't leave you, the world will keep on turnin'
But I'm thinkin' lately, what's so concernin'?
Soon as I leave you, I just keep on hurtin'

[Pre-Chorus: Troye Sivan]
And once we're off the tracks
It falls apart too fast
And we've been scared for too long, never really lasts
And once I get to thinkin', it all keeps comin' back, yeah, yeah

Before we leave it behind, we gotta get it alright

I hate where we left off
We probably should have left it on

I still got your face on the front of my phone

We'd say all the things we wish we said
In another life, maybe we're older

'Causе I still got these feelings for you, darling
Hitting me like waves right in my chest
In another life, if we start over
When the stars align, I'll meet you then
In another life

I heard when it's real love
It'll come back when you let it go
And baby, all this distance
It's only made my feelings grow

I still got your name on the tip of my tongue
And I still got your face on the lock on my phone
I know we both decided to leave it alone
And we probably shouldn't

In another life, if you came over
We'd say all the things we wish we said
In another life, maybe we're older
We won't have to lose this love again
'Cause I still got these feelings for you, darling
Hitting me like waves right in my chest
In another life, if we start over
When the stars align, I'll meet you then
In another life

Come over, come over, come over
In another life
Come over, come over, come over
In another life if you came over
We'd say all the things we wish we said
In another life, in another life"

혼자 있을 땐 언제나 그대 생각뿐이죠

소리 없이 내 마음을 채우고 싶어요

곱게 내 마음 접어서 나의 꿈도 날아서
아주 자유롭게 더 깊은 사랑 속으로

아주 바보 같은 질문을 했어
우리 혹시 헤어지지 않으면
안 되냐고
이제 얘기를 다 끝낸 후인데
그러자 너도 바보같이
대답을 못하고
멍하니 나만 바라보고 있어

너무 잘 알고 있어서
헤어지기가 너무 두려운 거야

I wasn't prepared
Now am I forgiven?
Oh
You look like you're so damn scared
I don't really think you care
You know you know that our time is through
It's over when I leave you said
we're never gonna meet again
You played your game it was all for you
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
It's all for you
Is it always just a stand in for a man
That can't heal?
Ooh
I've got arrows
Am I shooting through the sky for us still
Na na na
And I have a spent a year
Wondering if I had all of the blame
Ah yeah
And love's a bitter fruit
If you choose to remain in your shame
But you couldn't listen no
You look like you're so damn scared
I don't really think you care
You know you know that our time is through
It's over when I leave you said
We're never gonna meet again
You played your game it was all for you
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
It's all for you
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
It's all for you
Kneeling at your temple love was accidental
Singing bruises I was foolish
Thinking I was careful losing every battle
Singing bruises I was foolish
No hands no rush
No touch no drug
No blood no love
I'm doing it all for you
No hands no rush
No touch no drug
No blood no love
I'm doing it all for you
You look like you're so damn scared
I don't really think you care (Don't care)
You know you know that our time is through
(You know that our time is)
It's over when I leave you said
We're never gonna meet again
You played your game it was all for you
I said so long I said so long
I said so long It's all for you
I said so long I said so long
I said so long It's all for you"

I coulda sworn that I
Thought I adored you, I don't remember now
All that I thought we had
Is just a blurry mess when I'm looking back

All of the nights that we spent at yours fighting
All of the problems that came into light
Say that we're good but we know that we're lying
Can't find a reason to try 'cause

Everything about you I thought I loved
Was all just in my head, yeah I was making shit up
The heaven that I felt wasn't what it was
Saying it out loud
It just brings me down to earth

It just brings me down to earth
It just brings me down to earth

Saying it out
Saying it out loud
It just brings me down to earth
Brings me down to earth

Saying it out

I guess it's not your fault
That I imagined more than there really was
And I told everyone
That in the end I wanted it to be us but

All of the nights that we spent at yours fighting
All of the problems that came into light
Say that we're good but we know that we're lying
Can't find a reason to try 'cause

Everything about you I thought I loved
Was all just in my head, yeah I was making shit up
The heaven that I felt wasn't what it was
Saying it out loud

I caught the edge of a knife 
and it hurts just a little
And I know, and I know, and I know, 
and I know that I can't be your friend
It's my head or my heart, 
and I'm caught in the middle

My hands are tied, but not tied enough
You're the high that I can't give up
Oh lord, here we go

I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight
At the bottom of a bottle
You're the poison in the wine
And I know
I can't change you and I
I won't change
I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight

Let's be lonely together
A little less lonely together
 
Eyes wide shut and it feels like the first time
Before the rush to my blood was too much 
and we flatlined
And I know, and I know, and I know, 
and I know just how this ends
Now I'm all messed up 
and it feels like the first time

I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight
At the bottom of a bottle
You're the poison in the wine
And I know
I can't change you, and I
I won't change
I might hate myself tomorrow
But I'm on my way tonight

Don't be discouraged
Though I realise it's hard to
Take courage in a world full of people
You can lose sight of it
And the darkness inside you
Will make you feel so small
But I see your true colours
Shining through
I see your true colours
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colours true colours
True colours
Are beautiful like a rainbow
Show me a smile don't be unhappy
I can't remember
When I last saw you laughing
If this world makes you crazy and
You've taken in all you can bear
You call me up
Because you know I'll be there
But I see your true colours
Shining through
I see your true colours
And that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colours true colours
True colours
Are beautiful like a rainbow"

1235,Paralyzed,Big Time Rush(빅 타임 러시),"You, you walked into the room
On a Friday afternoon
That's when I saw you for the first time
And I was paralyzed
I had a million things to say
But none of them came out that day
'Cause I was never one of those guys
That always had the best lies

Time stopped tickin'
My hands keep shaking
And you don't even know that

I try to speak, but girl you got me tongue-tied
I try to breathe but I'm f-f-f-frozen inside
I try to move but I'm stuck in my shoes
You got me paralyzed, paralyzed, p-p-p-paralyzed
I see you walking, but all you do is pass me by
Can't even talk, cause words don't come into my mind
I'd make a move if I had the guts to
But I'm paralyzed, paralyzed, p-p-p-paralyzed

Now I learned a lot from my mistake
Never let a good thing slip away
I've had a lot of time to look back
And my only regret is

Not telling you what I was going through
You didn't even know that

I try to speak, but girl you got me tongue-tied
I try to breathe but I'm f-f-f-frozen inside
I try to move but I'm stuck in my shoes
You got me paralyzed, paralyzed, p-p-p-paralyzed
I see you walking, but all you do is pass me by
Can't even talk, cause words don't come into my mind
I'd make a move if I had the guts to
But I'm paralyzed, paralyzed, p-p-p-paralyzed

As the years go by I think about you all the time (whoa-oh)
If I get the chance I hope I won't be paralyzed, paralyzed by you

You walked into the room
On a Friday afternoon

I try to speak, but girl you got me tongue-tied
I try to breathe but I'm f-f-f-frozen inside
I try to move but I'm stuck in my shoes
You got me paralyzed, paralyzed, p-p-p-paralyzed (you got me paralyzed)

감기인 척을 또 했었고
Every day was my solo trip
울지 마 wu wu wu wu
다음에 얘기해
자자 잘 자 good night
이제 내 감정은 더 무뎌져
마주 보기 싫어 머릴 숙여
잘못한 거 없어 왜 울어 넌
But I don't wanna go back
I think about you but I won't call back
미안해 요즘 맘처럼 안돼
아직 많이 멀었어 now I got no time to love
너가 떠나려 해도 나는 잡을 수 없어
또 늦을 거 같애 잘 자 good night
내일 얘기해 잘 자 good night
I think about you but I won't call back

Nothing works you feel surrounded
Gotta give your feet
Some gravity to get you grounded
Keep good things inside your ears
Just like the waves and sound did
And just say whatever 'cause
There is no way around it
Everyone falls down sometimes

Smoke up a glimpse of heaven
I smoked 2 packs till the night
Sip on red wine I fall back
Can't stop this attraction
I can't see a thing
Laying with you I feel like
Moving clouds high in the sky
It's been too long since I
Realized you're real
Two heart come together
We were truly there
I fall down then I fall down
Puff of heaven
I feel like I'm in a day dream
I go up then I go up
I could I could be there for you
I could I could be the one to
I'd be your cigarette
I would I would be your light and
I would I would shine you bright(er)
Oh I wish I be your last (cigarette)
Smoke up a glimpse of heaven
Smoke up a glimpse of heaven
She's got the dance floor hella lit Then
she steps out for a cigarette
and I've been prayin' all night
that like God she gives life to my world
with a ""Can I get a light?""
Ignite a match
She leans in to catch it
We're the only spark in the dark
like a chandelier with no ceiling but the sky
As the smoke from her lips bleeds
into the atmosphere
No ashes here no dust
This moment is forever
Even though each puff will
take us further from together
She'll have me until the very last drag
Come to think of it love is like a cigarette
Burning at the tip of it but quick to burn out
Like a cigarette it may get you sick
but you'll never get sick of it
so light one up now
I could I could be there for you
I could I could be the one to
I'd be your cigarette
I would I would be your light and
I would I would shine you bright(er)
Oh I wish I be your last (cigarette)
I want you addicted to me
I was one of your cigarettes
the smell of your pastel breathing
just make me love you even more
my love is on fire
I could I could be there for you
I could I could be the one to
I would I would be your light and
I would I would shine you bright(er)
I could I could be there for you

그때는 취할 수 없었지
강해지려면 어젠
버리라고 배웠기에

안녕을 강요당했지만

Out of all the possible options

Where did I drop the ball?
I could feel the tension
I know we had our faults
Where did I drop the ball?
Tell me when was this all my fault
I heard the truth
But not from you
Who you ran to
Girl what I do?
Girl spare my heart
I'm in the dark
Lately we've been
Growing apart
I know all you wanted was for me
To be committed
I know I was acting distant
Like my feelings weren't in it
But I swear
I swear
My heart was there
I just was feeling scared
But I swear
I swear
My heart was there
I just was feeling scared
I heard that you
Think I hurt you
How is this true when I waited for you
I might've loved you
But I guess youll never know
How I felt for you there was nothing
Left for me to do
There was nothing left for me to do
Cus all I ever wanted was for you
To he committed
I know I was acting distant
But I really was just waiting for you
For you to come through
But I don't think
That'll happen anytime soon
So please don't go on tellin
Everybody it was easy
Oh the only difference was
He was brave enough to
Tell me even when I was waiting for you
I never meant to be unfair
I just wanted you to care

And all the stars aligned
You and I ended up in the same room
At the same time
And the touch of a hand lit the fuse
Of a chain reaction of countermoves
To assess the equation of you
Checkmate I couldn't lose
What if I told you none of it was accidental?
And the first night that you saw me
Nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork and then
Just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in the line
What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
And now you're mine
It was all by design
'Cause I'm a mastermind
You see all the wisest women
Had to do it this way
'Cause we were born to be the pawn
In every lover's game
If you fail to plan you plan to fail
Strategy sets the scene for the tale
I'm the wind in our free flowing sails
And the liquor in our cocktails
What if I told you none of it was accidental?
And the first night that you saw me
I knew that I wanted your body
I laid the groundwork and then
Just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line
What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
And now you're mine
It was all my design
'Cause I'm a mastermind
No one wanted to play with me as a little kid
So I've been scheming like a criminal ever since
To make them love me
And make it seem effortless
This is the first time I've felt the need to confess
And I swear
I'm only cryptic and Machiavellian
'Cause I care
So I told you none of it was accidental
And the first night that you saw me
Nothing was gonna stop me

Saw a wide smirk on your face
You knew the entire time
You knew that I'm a mastermind

If I was down would you even see 
I’m so tired of calling 
Out for someone to notice me

For so long crying please
Where were you when I was hurtin
Now that I’ve pulled back the curtain

But I'll be the song there in the silence, I
I'll always be your serenade, serenade, I
I'll always be your serenade

Let go, let go, darling, it's over now
You're on your own, but I'm on your shoulder, I
I'll always be your serenade, serenade, I
I'll always be your serenade

They told you
It's not the being drunk, it's being sober
That's when it really hits you that it's over
It's hard to say goodbye

So you can keep me
Somewhere out of reach but if you need me
Just hum these memories and you can feel me
I'm always standing by

Go and write your story, darlin'
You will find your place

Go on, go on, I'm not beside you
But I'll be the song there in the silence, I
I'll always be your serenade, serenade, I
I'll always be your serenade

Let go, let go, darling, it's over now
You're on your own, but I'm on your shoulder, I
I'll always be your serenade, serenade, I
I'll always be your serenade

You can always remember that
I'm here to ease your mind
I'm on your side and
You can call me and just like that
I'll sing a song to bring you home, babe

Go on, go on, I'm not beside you
But I'll be the song there in the silence, I
I'll always be your serenade, serenade, I
I'll always be your serenade

Let go, let go, darling, it's over now
You're on your own, but I'm on your shoulder, I
I'll always be your serenade, serenade, I
I'll always be your serenade

1371,don't fall,44phantom,"I was in my head so long, couldn’t get out
You were in that car that your daddy bought
I been trying to tell you
but it’s so d**n sad, it’s so sad

Now we just run around ‘til the sun is out
Then we shoot it off ‘til the gun is out
Then we reload it, shoot it again
And I just play along, sing your favorite song
Like it doesn’t matter, it wasn’t wrong
Even though it’s some sh*t I can’t stand

So baby don’t fall so hard for me
‘Cause I can’t be what you need
Don’t fall so hard for me
Cause I don’t wanna see, I don’t wanna be
Hating myself, hanging myself,
Hitting myself, hurting myself
Breaking myself, over someone else
So maybe don’t fall so hard for me
‘Cause I can’t be what you need

Even though I want to
Even though I want you
Even though you want someone who
Does the most that

I can go anywhere, own any pair
Ask myself who isn’t there
Still wanna be with you

Now we just run around ‘til the sun is out
Then we shoot it off ‘til the gun is out
Then we reload it, shoot it again
And I just play along, sing your favorite song
Like it doesn’t matter, it wasn’t wrong
Even though it’s some sh*t I can’t stand

So baby don’t fall so hard for me
‘Cause I can’t be what you need
Don’t fall so hard for me
Cause I don’t wanna see,I don’t wanna be

Ready on your mark
You ask for space then come around
Knocking on my heart

Insanity defined
Have we lost our minds?
'Cause you're gone
When I need you the most (Ah)
Where do you go whenever you go? (Ah)
To Everest and beyond
I never dreamed we'd get this far
A hope like us could crash my lungs
Don't let me down
Out in the backyard on my own
Staring up at dark
At all the places that you go
That swallow mе to Mars
I don't know where you are
But somewhere there's a place
Is there a place for us?

Maybe I'm lazy
Maybe I just feel overused

I've lost my fire
I'm going crazy
Stand up may I please
Be excused


The hours in the day seem a bit too few
I sleep in anyway what am I to loose
It's a pretty common phrase but it's all too true
Pride first and the fall and the follow through

And the days seem a bit faster than when I was young
My life is a disaster and its just begun
Maybe I'm depressed
I'm definitely depressed
Nice to get it off my chest, but
I'm a little еmbarrassed


The hours in the day seem a bit too fеw
I sleep in anyway what am I too loose?
It's a pretty common phrase but it's all too true
Pride first and the fall and the follow through

The hours in the day seem a bit too few
I sleep in anyway what am I too loose?
It's a pretty common phrase but it's all too true
Pride first and the fall and the follow through


Lately I just sit and ponder
I can't hold a thought they just wander
My head is an empty arena
No action potential could spark an idea
And now I feel like I'm the bad child
Didn't see that my head was so fragile
And I just wanna know what they see
Cause lately I'm thinking that maybe


I'm tired
Maybe I'm lazy
Maybe I just feel overused
I've lost my fire
I'm going crazy
Stand up may I please be excused


The hours in the day seem a bit too few
I sleep in anyway, what am I to loose

Stop the clocks it's amazing
You should see the way the light dances
off your hair
A million colours of hazel golden and red
Saturday morning is fading
The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand
My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again
We were love drunk waiting on a miracle
Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright
'til the darkness softly clears
Oh I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh I will hold on to the afterglow
The weather outside's changing
The leaves are buried under six inches of white
The radio is playing Iron & Wine
This is a new dimension
This is a level where we're losing track of time
I'm holding nothing against it
except you and I
We were love drunk waiting on a miracle
Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright
'til the darkness softly clears
Oh I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh I will hold on to the afterglow

Why do I keep begging like the animal?
Maybe it's because I need to serve someone

Lord you keep me crawling
Oh you keep me crawling
Lord you keep me crawling mmm
If I keep if I keep confessing
Maybe I'll believe 
that you never meant for love to hurt for me
Maybe you could feel a little sympathy
But why do I make you feel like 
you are big and strong?
Why do you keep hunting like an animal
Maybe it's because you need to own someone
So you keep me crawling on my knees
Oh you keep me crawling on my knees
Oh you keep me crawling on my knees
Lord you keep me crawling on my knees
Lord you keep me crawling on my knees
Lord you keep me crawling
Lord you keep me crawling

Better than this
When I know it exists
You're worried about me like I'm your child
Still believe how you still look and me
And smile
How can you smile?
Your morning shift is in a couple hours
You wouldn't miss a chance to be a shoulder
For me to cry on someone to confide in
You friends keep trying to save you from yourself
Saying she needs help
But not from you
It's time to move on to someone else and leave
Hit our miss your not her therapist
Give her some time to get her health together
Should be a crime to deny you
Better than this
When she knows it exists
Your always worried about her like she's a child
Still can't believe
How you're parting the sea
With a smile
How dare you smile"

Be light as Al B or black as Chauncey
Remember him from Blackstreet?
He was black as the street was
I'll never be laid back as this beat was
I never could see why people'll reach a
Fake ass facade that they couldn't keep up
You see how I creeped up?
You see how I played a big role in Chicago
Like Queen Latifah?
I'll never rock a mink coat
In the wintertime like Killa Cam
Or rock some mink boots
In the summertime like will I am
Let me know if you feel it man

I'm not made me everything I am

Haters start your engines
I hear 'em gearing up
People talk so much shit about me
At barbershops
They forget to get their hair cut
Okay fair enough the streets is flaring up
'Cause they want gun talk
Or I don't wear enough
Baggy clothes Reeboks or A di dos
Can I add that he do spaz out at his shows?
So say goodbye to the NAACP Award
Goodbye to the India Arie Award

The Ni Nigga Please Award

Do you know what it feel like
When people is passin'?
He got changed over his chains
A block off Ashland

Guess I could make some room

Fresh sheets on the edge of my king size
Top drawer for your things if you feel like
I'm sayin' if you wanna stick around in my life
There's a little space for you
Didn't ever really get it
Why they make tables for two?
But sippin' on this Cabernet 
I gotta say it's hittin' different next to you
I like your jokes I like your face
I love every way that you say my name
You're so cute and you're so smooth

Trying not to spiral

I haven't found the right road

I'm staying on my lifeline, hoping that it unwinds

Maybe I don't know, but we'll see where it goes

It's all gonna work out one day

Step up, fall behind

It's the way it's designed 'cause

Stop and rewind

Just to rewrite it over

Church next door we couldn't afford a tie
I was only 19 I was down for the ride (Woo)
Everything 
I wanted on my passenger side (Yeah)
Embrace who we was we was broke 
we was live
We would smoke we was high
We would smile just to grind
And fightin' to survive just to get ideas out
When niggas was hungry 
we couldn't afford the big house
Niggas was scrawny 
somebody break the ribs out
Fightin' over meals 
the crib was not Aunt Viv's house
Man press photo with the blue couch
Now we hate each other just to hang out

Oh oh oh (I know it ain't)
All that (I know it ain't)

Oh oh oh (I know it ain't)
All that (I know it ain't)

I can't stand seein' us not there
On the big screen with the homies here
We know once we get that shot
We gon' push limits 
and never look back' (Yeah uh)
Fast-forward everything feels backwards
Everything went left at the BRIT awards
When I decided not to show up or show support
'Cause I was tryna go solo 
before we went on tour (Come on)
Too much trauma for me to be 
at my highest (Come on)
I missed Ameer so me 
and Dom kept fightin' mm
He almost pushed me off the edge (Edge)
But honestly I shouldn't've said what I said
I shoulda went to therapy instead
Started to heal that's what we all needed
The record deal wasn't helpin' either (Come on)
That merch deal ain't help either (Come on)
It gave me more money for alcohol
I guess blowin' up ain't all that at all

Trunk rattlin, like two midgets in the backseat rasslin'

Well I was lookin at them, there there on the dancefloor
Now they got me in the middlin, feelin like a man-whore
.. 'specially the big girl
Big guls need love too, no discrimination here squirrel
So keep your hands off my cheeks
Let me study how you ride the beat, you big freak
Skinny slim women got the cameltoe within them
You can hump them, lift them, bend them, give them
something to remember, yell out
timber when you fall through the chop shop
Take a deep breath an exhale
Your ex-male friend boyfriend's borin as hell
But let me listen to the story you tell
And we can make moves like a person in jail, on the low hoe

Hey baby, girl don't you stop it
Come on lady, dance all around me
You look so fine (look so fine) look so fine

Oooh cause you light me, and excite me

Smell of weed is mixed with your perfume

And we're breakin' all the rules
Rollin' all night for miles
Let's leave and make a move
But then I'd have to break the groove
Don't get lost in it don't get lost in this

Hold up, stop ma, let me get a look at'cha
Damn girl, I ain't seen you since prom
Come to think about it, can't believe it's been that long
I heard your man locked down now, how long he gone?
Oh that long?How the hell'd he get time like that
Three strikes with posession - aw he ain't comin back
He left you with two kids and bills all around
Plus you found out he had another chick 'cross town
It's always the darkest, ah-right before the sunrisin
And you gotta stay strong, for the kids in they eyes and
And please don't despise, and go against all brothers
And have a hatred in your heart and take it out on another
I hate to sound Tupac-ish lil' mama, but +Keep Ya Head Up+
But you gon' make it, I promise - you keep your head up
And that that don't kill you only makes you stronger
And the will to succeed'll only feed the hunger, f'real {*echoes*}

I was at the gas station when a man walked past
With a sign ""will work for food, clothes or cash""
And he asked if he could pump my gas - so I let him
Clean the windshield and throw out the trash - so I let him
Hey, I even asked the brother his name
Where he was from, got kids man and what's they ages
He kinda sturred for a second, he kinda looked surprise
That anyone would even take an interest in his life
He said, ""Young brother dem the only wurrds, I done hurrd, in the last yurr
that wasn't low or get the fuck away from hurr""
How could somethin so simple as general conversation
mean much more than general conversation?Hey
You could tell life had beaten him down
Like he was in a title fight and this might be his last round
Sometimes the easiest things we take for granted
Until they gone, to realize we even had it, f'real {*echoes*}
Hey

I used to think that life had a plan for me
Until I realized, life meant to be planned by me
See that's the key, I only deal with what I can see
Cause over history, mystery brought us nuttin but mystery
Man mo' people done died, in the name of the Lord
Than in any natural disaster, disease or gang war
Before guns there was swords, and they was killin each other
Ain't much changed since the days, we still killin each other
Killin our brothers while another mother cries for help
Man, we need to help a brother find himself
Feed him, life, ah-one-twoooo, three
Hey, that's somethin e'ry brother should see, and that's f'real {*echoes*}

To a world of people who just simply need You

What You say can be done
I could be the one

It is amazing to see
That You chose people like me
Who get off track, fall, crashin' down to the ground
But that's when You pick me up
And show Your strength is enough
You can use a broken heart to heal a broken life

Doesn't matter where I'm from or where I am how far I've come

1413,Heaven,Fitz & The Tantrums,"Sometimes it feels like a feather
Sometimes it feels like a boulder
Sometimes the world makes it easy
Sometimes it falls on your shoulders
We say forever and ever
But we don't know when it's over
So, let's go so hard
We get to heaven hungover

Do it all for the chase (Okay)
Same time, different place (All day)
We do what it takes
To keep it going, don't know when
This party's all gone go away
So find that glass that you wanna raise
We can make some brand new memories
Just steady sippin'
Clock is tickin'

No I can't, lose this feeling I'm in
Gonna feel this in the morning
No I don't know what I'm doing, that's human

Sometimes it feels like a feather
Sometimes it feels like a boulder
Sometimes the world makes it easy
Sometimes it falls on your shoulders
We say forever and ever
But we don't know when it's over
So, let's go so hard
We get to heaven hungover

Heaven hungover

We know the deal
Leave it all out on the field
Ninety-five down the highway with nobody behind the wheel

No, I can't lose this feeling again
Gonna put it all down on red
And I don't care if I lose it, that's human

Sometimes it feels like a feather
Sometimes it feels like a boulder
Sometimes the world makes it easy
Sometimes it falls on your shoulders
We say forever and ever
But we don't know when it's over
So, let's go so hard
We get to heaven hungover

Heaven hungover

Nobody knows when it's over
So, let's go so hard
We get to heaven hungover

Do it all for the chase (Okay)
Same time different place (All day)
So hard that we make
Make it to heaven hungover

Sometimes it feels like a feather
Sometimes it feels like a boulder

You motherfuckers must be crazy

Run up in yo crib, snatch ya baby baby-baby
It's the kid still holdin' the crown
Now that they give it I'm holdin' a pound
And I'm lookin' for some bustas who be actin' like them niggas do dirt
Come to find out they ain't put in no work
An now my feelings is hurt
Cause they decided that they wanted to murk
But I'ma chase 'em to the end of the Earth
Cause I'm a motherfuckin' rider
You can see the pain in my face
Got no problem exchangin' the hate
They got me fightin' a case
And if I blow will I face a fifteen
And I'll probably do it all in the pen
But yo I'm livin' with it
Death before dishonor for my niggas that ride
A thousand deaths if ya sellin' ya pride ha ha ha
Death before dishonor for my niggas that ride
A thousand deaths if ya sellin' ya pride
You motherfuckers need to know that

I bought my bricks from these dro back stacks
It's the Birdman baby come and holla at me later
Duck ass niggas, we deal with 'em later
First you, go to the mall and you ball like a dog
And we drop the car, then holla at ya boy
Tell them pussy ass niggas, break bread with the boy

Tell Big Pun nigga, Stunna ride for the boy

But bullshit is walkin' out on four feet
That's why I'm ridin' on ya whole street
I'll be a nigga till it's said and done
I'm from a section where ya fight till ya die cause ya never run
I keep my forty cal cocked cause these niggas on my block bang
Right up the street from where the cops hang
And in my head I hear Pac sang
And then them rushin' memories make me cry till I can't stop man
Tell my mama I'm a killer if I happen to die
That's how I lived, ain't no sense in me lyin'
My whole life's filled with danger
Never been a stranger to homicide
My neighborhood's full of gangstas and drive-bys
And niggas fightin' for position
The demon has risen from out of prison
Now I'm losin' my religion
That's how I'm feeling when I'm fuckin' with you
Cause I don't fuck with you, now I'm bustin' at you
So fuck you dude

that you're catching up with an old friend
He needs to know
It's someone else

Taking up the space he's supposed to be in
When you gonna leave
And circle back to me?

You should dump him

that you're in love with him
You wanna be
but you've been drowning in comparisons
He doesn't get your sense of humor
so you're reaching out again oh
I feel for him
He needs a friend
Someone to tell him that you're texting them

冷たさと残酷さに気付いたんだよ
きっと君に渡したいものはもっとひんやり熱いもの
綺麗事じゃ無いけど　綺麗で揺るぎないもの
うわべよりも胸の奥の奥を温めるもの
理想だけはあるけど　心のどこ探しても
まるで見つからないんだよ

夢中になればなるほどに

消えてしまうけど

そこに託された想いが
君の胸を震わすのを　諦められない
愛してるよりも愛が届くまで
もう少しだけ待ってて

不必要に汗をかいてしまう僕なんかもう
どうしたって生温くて君を痛めつけてしまうのだろう

冗談でもそんな残酷なこと言わないでよ
別に言えばいいけど　全人生を賭けても
ちゃんと覆さしてよ
救いたい＝救われたい
このイコールが今
優しく剥がしていくんだよ
堅い理論武装
プライドの過剰包装を
正しさよりも優しさが欲しい
そしてそれを受け取れるのは
イルミネーションみたいな
不特定多数じゃなくてただ1人
君であってほしい
かけた言葉で　割れたヒビを直そうとして
足しすぎた熱量で　引かれてしまったカーテン
そんな失敗作を
重ねて　重ねて　重ねて
見つけたいんだいつか
最高の一言一句を
言葉はまるで雪の結晶
君にプレゼントしたとして
時間が経ってしまえば大抵
記憶からこぼれ落ちて溶けていって
消えてしまう　でも
絶えず僕らのストーリーに
添えられた字幕のように
思い返した時
不意に目をやる時に
君の胸を震わすもの　探し続けたい
愛してるよりも愛が届くまで
もう少しだけ待ってて
言葉など何も欲しくないほど
悲しみに凍てつく夜でも
勝手に君のそばで
あれこれと考えてる
雪が溶けても残ってる"

予測できない帰りを待ってる私がいる
ひとつになる度、期待すること
近くにいればいつかは待ってる? 柔い時間
見過ぎた理想と笑われたこと
私の隅で小さく高鳴ってる 未来が泣く

わがままかしら?

貴方の心を奪えたら
寒さに負けないような
ぬくもりで貴方のことを
温めてあげられる
自信のある恋ばかりじゃないけれど
私のこの眼に嘘がないこと
解って欲しい
きっと これは恋の始まり
伝えれば済むと分かってること
遠くに行かないでよって少し、胸が言いたい
寝つけない夜に 暴れ出す鼓動
私の中溢れ出す愛情で 締め付けたい
ずっと笑っているのも
起きてすぐ描くアイラインも
ただ貴方に
貴方に認めて欲しいから
誰にも負けないような
ぬくもりで貴方のことを
抱きしめてあげられる
自慢できるほどの恋はしたことがないけど
私は貴方を
たまに怒らせたりして
優柔不断に泣いて
貴方を困らせる天才だね
でも、ふたり結ばれてから
始まる恋もあるよ?
だから 今日も 貴方を想ってる

Transformed your love into like

In your pocket 
Of dreams

Chorus

I know it I’ve seen them babe
I tasted your pink champagne
I swam in your ocean
Trophies to your name
Don’t make me one of them
I tasted your pink champagne
I swam in your ocean
Trophies to your name

You are what I’ve been looking for
You’re everything I need and babe 
I want more – just hold on
As I am yours

Nothing seems right
It's like you're walking through a cloud
Lay it all on me
Raindrops roll down your cheek
When life turns out a little different than
Your dreams
Lay it all on me
'Cause even if the sky is falling down
Nothing could change my love
And even if your heart is filled with doubt
I swear I won't give up
And I'll be here to remind you
That you'll always be enough
Whenever life gets too heavy
Lay it all on me
Lay it all on me
When you feel out of place
You're in my arms
But you're a million miles away
It's okay
Lay it all on me
When you can't sleep at night
You feel so tired
But you just can't turn off your mind
Lay it all on me
'Cause even if the sky is falling down
Nothing could change my love
And even if your heart is filled with doubt
I swear I won't give up
And I'll be here to remind you
That you'll always be enough
Whenever life gets too heavy
I might not be able to fix a single thing
But I'll stay right here beside you
No matter what life brings
So lay it all on me"

 Don't break the heart
 That's loving you

 I'm sitting here in this lonely room
 No, there's nothing left, it's only me and you
 Holding onto heaven
 But the heavens closed down on me

 Nothing lasts forever, nothing goes to plan
 Don't you lose your grip, you're letting go of my hand
 'Cause every single second
 Is a second that we can't get back

 Here we go, growing cold in the silence
 Never know till you hear all the sirens
 I should go but if this is the end of the line then
 Hold me close

 And we can lay here one last time
 Don't slip away, leave me behind
 I'm on my knees, I'm begging you
 Don't break the heart
 That's loving you

 Try my best at being brave
 But this is more than I can take
 I'm on my knees, I'm begging you
 Don't break the heart
 That's loving you

 One minute here then you're gone the next
 Turning into strangers like we never met
 Counting every blessing
 Like a lesson that you taught me

 Here we go, growing cold in the silence
 Never know till you hear all the sirens
 I should go but if this is the end of the line then
 Hold me close

 And we can lay here one last time
 Don't slip away, leave me behind
 I'm on my knees, I'm begging you

Knowing little but wanting more
Don't know what I do this for
From a distance
It sinks in, the reality of it all
Making it up, now I'm falling
Into a thought that I made with your facade
I think it again, I think it again
All my thoughts are just pretend
I think it again, I think it again
Maybe I should make this end
I think it again, I think it again
I think it again, think it again
This all happens too much
After one night, I build it up
From nothing to something
You just keep on talking
But you leave out the parts I know you try to hide
Making it up, now I'm falling
Into a thought that I made with your facade
I think it again, I think it again
All my thoughts are just pretend
I think it again, I think it again
Maybe I should make this end
I think it again, I think it again
I think it again, think it again
Keep on hoping that you try
To open up and help decide
If I should keep holding on to you
Don't know who you really are
Because I see just what I want
Knowing you could cause it all to stay
I think it again, I think it again
All my thoughts are just pretend
I think it again, I think it again
Maybe I should make this end
I think it again, I think it again
I think it again, think it again"

1509,NIGHTS LIKE THESE,Benson Boone,"The lights are low
My hands are cold against the wheel
And you still have my coat
Eyes are lost in the fog without you here
And I can't see the road
Now I'm standing at your door
And I hope that you're not home
So I can get used to being alone
On nights like these
when my willpower's weak
I'm gonna call so just let it ring
I'll drive these streets
don't come looking for me
If you're letting go then I'm gonna need
More nights like these
I fight the Earth to write the words up
in my head
That I know I shouldn't send
(That I know I shouldn't send)
It's hard to heal
when I keep stealing glances at your picture
So I look away again
On nights like these
when my willpower's weak
I'm gonna call so just let it ring
I'll drive these streets
don't come looking for me
If you're letting go then I'm gonna need
More nights like
You gotta let me drown
You gotta let me fall apart
Without you here to catch me
And if you're not around
I gotta learn to face the dark
'Cause days turn into nights like these

1511,The Hard Way,Pale Waves,"We were just strangers
Didn't know your name but
I could tell you were good at hiding your pain
The ones you kept closest
Didn't even notice
But I saw your heartache yet I stayed away
And lately it's haunting me I didn't protect you
Your skin was still thickening but I just assumed
That you were okay
But I learnt the hard way
Thought it wasn't my place
But I learnt the hard way
You left us too soon
Such pain they put you through
Only felt safe in your room
needed someone to turn to
A delicate flower
They took all your power
And got in your head before you could even bloom
But lately it's haunting me I didn't protect you
Your skin was still thickening but I just assumed
That you were okay
But I learnt the hard way
Thought it wasn't my place
But I learnt the hard way
Pretending everything's okay
I should've taken on your weight
Then I wouldn't have to learn the hard way
And why does someone have to lose?
And why did that have to be you?
Wish I didn't have to learn the hard way
Pretending everything's okay
I should've taken on your weight
Then I wouldn't have to learn the hard way
And why does someone have to lose?
And why did that have to be you?
Wish I didn't have to learn the hard way"
