They just gonna tell that it wasn't real
And I just wanna tell you how I feel

4,How Does It Feel?,Samm Henshaw(샘 핸쇼우),"How does it feel to be loved?
I just landed on this earth today
Heard people acting crazy over
Something strange
Brothers be paying for diamonds
That they can't afford
Just to keep up the appearance for a polaroid
All I see is something crazy
I don't understand
Ladies making babies just to keep a man
Fellas chasing stellas when they got a pam
They go from stephanie to bethany
From definitely to never be so
(How does it feel to be loved?)
Oh how does it feel?
That's what they say
Ooo must be insane oh yeah
(How does it feel to be loved?)
Somebody has gotta tell me oh yeah
It goes time right swipe right
Deep like five times
Don't know what it sounds like
But someone told me
It's a little marvin with some candle light
A little ocean on the weekend
With a can of sprite
I mean I love 'em white
Ooo love is such a mystery
I'm so perplexed by all the things
My eyes have let me see
People think that love is things
Like physicality
When in reality it's meant to
Hold you down like gravity
(How does it feel to be loved?)
How does it feel to be loved?
That's what they say
Oh my must be insane oh yeah
(How does it feel to be loved?)
How does it feel how does it feel? Yeah
You see now
How am I supposed to find love?
If I don't understand love
How am I supposed to be loved? Ooh
And if I have to buy love
Then I don't really want love
If this is what it means
The fighting and the screams
You want dependency
I need some therapy oh
(How does it feel to be loved?)
I gotta know I ain't too sure
Somebody tell me
How does it feel to be loved?
(How does it feel to be loved?)
I just wanna know yeah
I just gotta know yeah

Lost lingo, Bronx's only Django
Snap, he'd got less tougher

That's where my pops went
See my percentage is a pennant to the planet
Knock it out the ball park, Frankie
I should not tire this tire
To a better love, let the wings spread
It'll always come back, baby
Come back, shellac black, baby
A come back, flat black paint on a Chevy

If she don't love me, what can I do?
Just put on my best pair of shoes

Listen to my tone, you ain't catchin' you a Tony
Award-winning walk when you running with a shottie
Why you running from us?
Why you messing with us?
We ain't got no guns, we just let the bears witness
The Grizzly, maybe Polar
You ain't ready, you ain't ready 'ready rolled up
Pulling a machete, cut the bamboo paper
And let's roll out baby

Thought that it was time to say goodbye
I see you in the corner of my eye
Smiling like you'll never say goodbye
Can barely hold your gaze and I'm not shy
The words escape me as you pass on by
So graciously I told him of the glitter in his eye
And he said it's your reflection darling
And he said it's your reflection baby
I see the good in you
Do you see it too?
I see the good in you
Do you see it too?
What's your name or can I call you mine?
All I want is a moment of your time
'Cuz I see the good in you
Do you see it too?
Simple but I
Can't organize my thoughts
You make them fly
Feeling like I've never seen the sky
The colors blue and light like crystal I
Hope that you can read what's on my mind
Simple but I
Told him of the glitter in his eye

Then he said it's your reflection babe
I see the good in you
Do you see it too?

What's your name or can I call you mine?

Will you see it too?
Is that your skin or mine?
Is that your heart of mine?

You ever wonder what it means to make it by any means and finally obtain your dreams
On the come up, but they run up in a world of many fiends
I been at it since a teen, get this money, get the cream
Hard work and sacrifice but not a lot know what it mean
Most these rappers, ain't got no class like bomb threats
And bein' the illest, the disease, is the on set
And it don't matter where you at
If you white, if you black, if you rich, or you poor, we gon' always want more
But one thing I can be sure, as long as I got the floor
I'm 'gon use this power to paint a picture of unity
Yeah I'm rippin' it up with that energy like there's two of me
Fuck the lights and the cameras, right now it's just you and me

One day (one day)

So ahead of my time, I wasn't born in the past
This right here a double-header with Logic and Ryan Tedder
Oh no, it can't get no better
And you know– you know we do it for the children
I never thought I'd see the day I made a million
A couple thousand later, feel like everybody feel 'em
I ain't mean to boast in that last line
But counting moneys always been my favorite past time
Especially with a past like mine
Drugs in the household
Never had a hand to hold
Even when I was homeless in the blistering cold, but I made it out
And if I can, you can no doubt
I know

One day (one day)
I'ma do it like I never did it
One day (one day)
I'ma have the courage to go out and get it
One day (one day)
Do what I love and support my girl (one day)
I'ma shake up the whole world

And maybe one day I'll be wiser

Only thing I know it's gonna be all right (one day)

22,Simple Romance,COIN,"Heartless princess
Effortless
You got a touch in your hand
Second guess
I guess I'm complex
So thoughtless
It’s what you do to me

Scream until I'm blue
Yeah, I'm losing my edge
Then she’s air in my chest
What ya got in your hand?
Drag my feet to bed
While you're living your best
Now I'm kind of a mess
It's what you do to me
It's what you do to me

You can try to simplify romance
Reduce it to a touch
But maybe we're in love
You can try to simplify romance
You could call it odd attraction
Pulling like a magnet
(You can try)

Black and white
Rainbow
It's chemical
What you do to me

Scream until I'm blue
Yeah, I’m losing my edge
Then she’s air in my chest
Breathing life in
Drag my feet to bed
While you're living your best
Now I’m kind of a mess
It's what you do to me
It's what you do to me

You can try to simplify romance
Reduce it to a touch
But maybe we're in love

The more we speak the less we say
Just searching for a friendly face
In love with what we wanna hate (It's what you do)
In love with what we wanna hate

Reduce it to a touch
But maybe we're in love
You can try to simplify romance
Call it odd attraction
Pulling like a magnet

No sterling silver
No greenback fountains glittering down
I'm waiting on my day to come
No champagne dinners
Cause I can't pay the bill
When we're out

I got nothing in my pockets
Tell me baby do you judge me
I got money problems
I got money problems
I been thinking way to often
Maybe only gold is flawless
I got money problems
I got money problems

Hey
Whether you started from the bottom
Or you're coming from the top of the chain
You're either looking for a way to get it
Or a way to cover your safe
But don't sweat it
When they take their percentage
Cause what goes baby comes around

No sterling silver
No greenback fountains glittering down
I'm waiting on my day to come
No champagne dinners
Cause I can't pay the bill
When we're out

I got nothing in my pockets
Tell me baby do you judge me
I got money problems

Maybe only gold is flawless

Falling from the sky
Where you been your face it's
Always on my mind

I dream of when I get some ends
And all my friends are screaming

Staring up at the moon in June
Mesmerized by her in July
Wish it didn't have to end so soon

작품들이 대부분이고,
실제로 마티나 맥브라이드가 불렀던 Valentine,
CCM 가수 마이클 W.스미스와 함께 한
'Love Of My Life'등 팝 발라드 곡들도 히트시켰다.
데이브 코즈와 같은 팝 친화적 재즈 뮤지션들과

I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
And now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn, to win some or learn some

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love
Listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing
We're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved loved loved loved loved

So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm sure
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours
But do, do, do, do you, but do you, do, do, do you, but do you want to come on, scooch on over closer, dear
And I will nibble your ear

I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bendin' over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
I guess what I'm saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours

Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours
So please don't, please don't, please don't

Steal some covers, share some skin
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew
That someday it would lead me back to you
That someday it would lead me back to you

That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

Fingers trace your every outline
Paint a picture with my hands
Back and forth we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather, still together when it ends

That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
Sunday morning, rain is falling and I'm calling out to you
Singing, ""Someday it'll bring me back to you.""
Find a way to bring myself back home to you

Why does every moment have to be so hard?

I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
The taste of her breath I'll never get over
And the noises that she made kept me awake

Built up so much it crushed us everyday

I’m scared of falling into deep this time

Do I need a reason to show you that
I know where I belong
Whenever I am weary I lean on
this feeling that I have
I am so much stronger now
 Thankful, yes I am

Today I’ll renounce them,
the doubts and the fears I’ve been nursing
I’ll fly like a moth to the flame
and I’ll feel like the first time
To hold back my fear
and let you come near

To hold back my fear
and let you come near
I’m fraid of loosing and still I go

129,Honesty,Pink Sweat$,"She said Baby I'm afraid to fall in love
Cause what if it's not reciprocated?
I told her Don't rush girl don't you rush
Guess it's all a game of patience
She said What if I dive deep?
Will you come in after me?
Would you share your flaws with me?
Let me know
I told her Thinking is all wrong
Love will happen when it wants
I know it hurts sometimes
But don't let it go
Cause I want you I want you
I want I want you
Cause I want you I want you
I want I want you
She said
What if I tell you all the things I've done?
Would you run away from me?
I told her Baby we all got bags
Full of shit that we don't want
But I can't unpack it for you baby
She said What if I dive deep?
Will you come in after me?
Would you share your flaws with me?
Let me know
I told her Thinking is all wrong

130,Movie,Tom MischCONNECT 아티스트,"My cheek brushes against his
Smooth on stubble for a moment
And then it's gone
He walks along the platforms into the dream
Every fiber in me wants to shout and scream
'Stop'
To run across to him take him into my arms
To tell him
'I love you you silly silly man I love you'
But instead I stand still
Heart cracking
These little curls on the back
Of his head bouncing
As he steps out of my life forever
I hope
That the fire we both made
Still burns a little in you
I wrote to you
Everyday did my letters find their way?
Our memories on my screen
Two lovers in this mystic dream
Baby come back to me come back to me
Too much time on my phone
Baby do you still sleep alone?
Come back to me come back to me
Remember me
Fresh out a black and white movie movie
On every screen
What would you realize
What you meant to me was a mystery
Remember me
Fresh out a black and white movie movie
On every screen
What would you realize
What you meant to me was a mystery
I heard
That you moved somewhere far away
Is your number the same as before?
Can't ignore the time
May have changed your ways
Does my record still hang on your wall?
Such a sentimental way to groove
I hope it still touches you
Baby come back to me come back to me
It kills me to see you leave
So I came home and made this beat
Baby come back to me come back to me
Remember me
Fresh out a black and white movie movie
On every screen
What would you realize
What you meant to me was a mystery
Remember me
Fresh out a black and white movie movie
On every screen
What would you realize
What you meant to me was a mystery
Remember me let's set the scene
You and me what could've been
Still swimming in a lover's dream
Still playing on the movie screens
Remember me let's set the scene
You and me what could've been
Still swimming in a lover's dream
Still playing on the movie screens
Remember me let's set the scene
You and me what could've been
Still swimming in a lover's dream
Still playing on the movie screens
Remember me let's set the scene
You and me what could've been
Still swimming in a lover's dream
Still playing on the movie screens"

and I can’t wait till i’ve ascended,
to those pearly gates in heaven
if they take one look at my punk ass just forget it
i won’t get in, cuz

i think life has passed me by you can say goodbye

ooh

i sleep myself into a coma
on this whiskey scented sofa
strum away my days instead of trying to go for
my diploma, so

I tell myself that I’m an artist
it’s how i wish to be regarded
it’s a full time job being a f**king fraud and that’s where my heart is,
 cuz

my whole life has passed me by you can say goodbye

This cycle of another song, a different day
It feels so fake, copy and paste
A formulaic version of the things I say


We need a hit by Monday, Monday
If you wanna be a star, star
Gonna write a hit about 
Bacardi, parties, bars, cars
If you wanna make money, money
If you wanna be a star, star
Starting to think that


S-s-society sucks, I think I messed up
I think I sold out when the sales went up
Society sucks, I wanna refund
When you get what you want,
 but it's never enough
Society


Hang on, I thought I was winning, winning
I made a fool of myself
Society sucks, I think I messed up
I think I sold out on the day
 I signed up for society


Ironically, I wanna be a piece of everything
 I hate on TMZ
I need a space to rearrange 
this messy room I'm living in inside my brain


Another hit by Monday, Monday
If you wanna be a star, star
Gonna write a hit about 
Bacardi, parties, bars, cars
If you wanna make money, money

I made a fool of myself
Society sucks, I think I messed up
I think I sold out on the day 
I signed up for society


My head or my heart, the cash or the art
I stop to restart, I put up a guard
The glaze in your stare, 
the pressure in the air
You made me feel dumb, I wasn't aware
My chords are too jazz
My lyrics are too sad
My thoughts are too dark
Well shit, that's too bad
The game knocked me out
I guess I'll check out
I guess I'll check out
I guess I'll check out

S-s-society sucks, I think I messed up
I think I sold out when the sales went up
Society sucks, I wanna refund

Don't wanna be irrational
And make the same mistakes again
Would you be there
5am on a weekend?

Never second guessing with you
Don't wanna wake up
Wishing I never gave love
Wishing I never gave trust
Knowing it wasn't true
If I was your hero would you be mine?
I know this ain't a fairytale this is real life
But if I were to save you
Would you do the same?
And catch me if I'm fallin'
Fallin' fallin' fallin'?
If I was your hero would you be mine?
I know this ain't a fairytale this is real life
But if I were to save you
Would you do the same?
And catch me if I'm fallin' fallin' fallin' fallin'?
Maybe I'm better off alone
At least that's what my mind is saying
I think I've been through way too much
So you gotta assure
That this love is sure
Would you be there
5am on a weekend?
Through the thick and the thin
Never second guessing with you
Don't wanna wake up

Another pointless song about someone 
who doesn't give a shit about me

So I'm looking through my memories
Falling into jealousy
How can I miss you
You're really just my enemy
Breaking apart but I gotta hold my legacy
And I don't wanna die young
I know that's not my destiny

So I'm looking through my memories
Falling into jealousy
How can I miss you
You're really just my enemy

Falling into jealousy
How can I miss you
You're really just my enemy
Breaking apart but I gotta hold my legacy
And I don't wanna die young
I know that's not my destiny

Ya I'm searching for my destiny
Tripping for a better me
I don't wanna break your heart
So you better leave
It's not that I don't love you
I'm just losing myself mentally
And yeah I'd rather scream
Than use you as my remedy

I'm scared to open up
I'm scared to really feel
Afraid of my own mind
I don't know if I will heal
I wish that you weren't real
I wish this ended when I woke up
And my high is my sobriety
I wish someone would save us

I know it's not my destiny
To die without a legacy
I guess I am my enemy
Ya why'd I look through memories

So I'm looking through my memories
Falling into jealousy
How can I miss you
You're really just my enemy
Breaking apart but I gotta hold my legacy
And I don't wanna die young
I know that's not my destiny

So I'm looking through my memories
Falling into jealousy
How can I miss you
You're really just my enemy
Breaking apart but I gotta hold my legacy
And I don't wanna die young

Just a feeling think about it
이런 나도 맘이 편한게 아냐
혹시라도 니가 돌아설 까봐
그만 내게 말해 줘 나를 사랑한다고
기다리고 있잖아
Just a feeling 느낀 그대로 말해
Think about it 주저하지마
Just be waiting 이젠 준비가 됐어
너는 내게 줘 내가 갖겠어
Just a feeling 느낀 그대로 말해
Think about it 주저하지마

이 지구를 번쩍 들어 너에게 줄 테니까
내 손바닥 위 저 별을 담지
다 잠든 이 우주 위에 우리만 깨어있지
널 볼 때마다 맘이 넘치고 커져
과장이 아닌 진심인 걸
늘 바라 난 네 그림자 다음으로
내가 가장 가깝기를 Girl
늘 너의 곁에 I wanna be
고맙지 않을 만큼 더 당연하길
열 걸음 채 걷기 전 날 찾을 수 있게
항상 너의 곁에 I wanna be
늘 너의 안에 I wanna be
외로울 때는 날 떠올리길
지금 이 노래가 채 끝나기도 전에
항상 너의 안에 I wanna be
사랑해 사랑해 라는 말도
나의 마음은 표현 못 하는 걸
가진 걸 전부 주고만 싶어
내 꿈도 변했어 너와 함께 하는 거로
매일 곁에 있을게
단 일 분도 외롭지 않게 할게
내 맘을 전부 비울 게 오직 너만 살게 할게
널 향한 내 맘 멜로디로 바꾸면
이 노랜 오늘 안 끝날 걸
근데 말이야 이것도 부족해서
난 다시 흥얼대겠지 This song
늘 너의 곁에 I wanna be
고맙지 않을 만큼 더 당연하길
열 걸음 채 걷기 전 날 찾을 수 있게
항상 너의 곁에 I wanna be

외로울 때는 날 떠올리길
지금 이 노래가 채 끝나기도 전에
항상 너의 안에 I wanna be

하늘까지 (Wherever you go)
어디나 (Wherever you go)
함께야
해 뜰 때 (Whenever you want)
저물 때 (Whenever you want)
언제나 (Whenever you want)
너와
늘 너의 안에 I wanna be
외로울 때는 날 떠올리길

항상 너의 안에 I wanna be
I wanna be baby
I wanna leave all to get to you girl
항상 너의 안에 I wanna be"

가로수 그늘 아래 너와 함께 거닐면

무더운 이 여름에 복잡한 세상 일을
잠시 다 잊을 수도 있을것 같아
넌 나의 숲이야 넌 나의 나무야
니 곁에 있으면 시원한 바람이 느껴져

오직 (아우) 한복판 가운데다

난 너의 곁에 한 손 가득 팝콘을 들고

놀란척 니 어께에 얼굴을 꼭 묻으면
이 밤은 천국보다 아름다운 걸
넌 나의 바다야 넌 나의 파도야
니 품에 안기면 내 안에 파도소리가 들려
무더운 이 여름에 복잡한 세상 일을

훨훨 날아가 너에게로 다가갈 수 있도록 하얀 진심을 담아
새롭게 시작해 볼래 너 그리고 나 
사랑을 동경해 앞으로도 잘 부탁해 
모아둔 마음을 주겠어 그리고 나 마냥 기다리진 않을래
다시 선 시작점이야 조금 더 속도를 올려서
물러선 나의 마음을 달래고 이제는 더 다가갈게
꽃처럼 피어나 나나나 나빌레라 아직은 수줍은 아이야
나도 떨려와 우리 설렘 가득한 목소리로 하얀 진심을 담아
새롭게 시작해 볼래 너 그리고 나 
사랑을 동경해 앞으로도 잘 부탁해 
모아둔 마음을 주겠어 그리고 나 마냥 기다리진 않을래
바라고 바랐던 이 순간에 항상 내 곁에 있어준 
너와 함께 나 언제나 그래왔듯 이룰 거니까
꿈에서 깨어나 나나나 나빌레라 언젠가 너와 나 둘이서
활짝 펼쳐진 미래를 만들어가고 싶은걸 너 하나면 충분하니까

Too much to handle, to hold

I've found that it always ends up cold

Is it healthy

Is it safe

To have my heart all

Over the place

So many times, yeah

It's gone to waste

Why do I struggle

To soften the pace

If there's another day
I guess I have been there
I guess I am there now

And you fought so hard
Just to find yourself
Sitting in a golden cage
In a golden cage
So of course I miss you
And miss you bad
But I also felt this way
When I was still with you
Yes of course I miss you
And miss you bad
But I also felt this way
When I was still with you
This city's no longer mine
There's sadness written
On every corner
Each lover was made to sign
Now I hear them calling me

a simple and decisive tone
Her sweet admission left me 
feeling in position from

I don't take these things so personal
Anymore, Anymore
I don't think it's irreversible
Anymore

Somebody hooted 
and they hollered can I buy a vowel
Don't let her catch you 
in the act of throwing in the towel
And when it's not as it appears to be
the flagrant foul
Can I put my fingers in your mouth 
before you start to growl

I don't think that it's so terrible
Anymore, Anymore
I don't think that it's unbearable
Anymore

Tell me now
I know that it just won't stop
You will find 
your flow when you go robot
I want to thank you 
and spank you upon your silver skin
Robots don't care where I've been
You've got to choose it to use it
 so let me plug it in
Robots are my next of kin

Sometimes I feel like 
I'm a sentimental trooper

 you know she looked like Alice Cooper

I'm kissing high and low
Our bodies like two dominoes
Can I come and get you when 
I hit you in your party clothes
Let's turn this cosplay holiday
what we obey
And now we're welcoming 
each other to this cabaret

I don't think that it's so terrible
Anymore, Anymore
I don't think that it's unbearable

294,Even When The Water's Cold,!!!(Chk Chk Chk),"Friends told her she was better off 
at the bottom of a river
than in a bed with him
he said until you try both
you won't know what you like better
why don't we go for a swim?
well, friends told her this and friends told her that
but friends don't choose what echoes in your head
when she got bored with all the idle chit and chat
kept thinking about what he said

I'll swim even when the water's cold
that's the one thing that i know 
Even when the water's cold

She remembers it fondly, she doesn't remember it all
but what she does, she sees clearly
she lost his number, and he never called
but all she really lost was an earring
the other's in a box with others she has lost
i wonder if she still hears me

I'll swim even when the water's cold
that's the one thing that i know 
Even when the water's cold

If you believe in love
then you know that sometimes it isn't
Do you believe in love?
then save the bullshit questions
sometimes it is and sometimes it isn't 
sometimes it just how the light hits their eyes
Do you believe in love?"

I’m trying to be honest
See all the point of views
You tell me that you’re leaving
But I wish you would stay
I think this is worth it but

Do you feel the same?

So if you’re thinking “not today”
I’d rather have the truth than start a love that’s fake

without the letdowns
I overcomplicate
I underestimate
How easy it is to live like this
Feel better if I take my time

Outside, the rain's done dancing 
with the storm clouds
But inside, there's not a dry eye 
in this whole house
And it ain't sadness 
why these tears keep falling down now
I know I'm not alone, 
I just get caught up in myself
I overcomplicate
I underestimate
I know that there's a love that's gonna find me

For you baby)
You see I had a love song
It was all planned out
I wrote up a storm it was a real standout
Couldn't let my perfect ideas just go to waste
Guess my time ran out yeah
I had some clever ass lyrics
I felt like Kanye thought I was a genius
From the verses to the chorus
And the part with all the ad libs
It really had a lot of meaning
I really wish that you could hear it
Now there's no point in finishing I lost the spirit
Keep it in my drafts then one day
It'll disappear and whoa
And well I just wish
You knew what I was feeling
Oh I don't think you would understand
But I just wish that this song went
As planned yeah
I had a love song it was all planned out
I wrote up a storm it was a real standout
Couldn't let my perfect ideas just go to waste
Now I can't put it out
Lyrics in my head for days
I had something more to say
Wish you could read everything I've said
Pages go on and on 'cause you
Touch me in my spirit
Hit me with some meaning
I've been a mess for longer days
Listen to my heartstrings playing
Oh I don't think you would understand
I just wish that this song went as planned
You see I had a love song
It was all planned out
I wrote up a storm it was a real standout
Couldn't let my perfect ideas just go to waste

 Couldn't see a damn thing
 And right then I knew you weren't real
 I'm an addict for you bad ways
 I swear you make me feel things
 Things my body ain't never felt

 But you only love me when I'm high
 You leave me lonely when I'm low
 Reaching out for you I'm falling
 Cuz you never let me know
 You're somebody else's lover
 But I need you right in my covers
 You moved on to another
 Leaving a trail of hearts
 You used me for my body
 You made me feel like I'm naughty
 But you do this to everybody
 Leaving a trail of hearts

 Why you have to hurt me
 I have you good, you gave me dirty
 Now my heart is double plated with steel
 You gave love a bad name
 Now I'm afraid to feel things
 Afraid that I won't know what is real

 Cuz you only love me when I'm high
 You leave me lonely when I'm low
 Reaching out for you I'm falling
 Cuz you never let me know
 You're somebody else's lover
 But I need you right in my covers
 You moved on to another
 Leaving a trail of hearts
 You used me for my body
 You made me feel like I'm naughty

I'm telling you it don't feel right
And even if it was good
I didn't feel the way I should
To give you all that you deserve
But you took it bad and now I'm hurt

I say that's fine, you know I
Lie to keep it cool, but we'll keep being fools
So I hope you're okay, won't tell your

The first time that we met 
I thought you were the one
We were dancing at 2 AM until we saw the sun
You walked into my heart, but
Hearts don't always end up in the right place
I said goodbye to the thing that I thought I loved
I can't go back to the kiss where it all begun
I see the hurt in your face and
I wish that I could wipe it all away, and

And I tried so hard to want this
Love we're hanging on, 
but now I'm giving up, so
Trust me when I say that I've done
All that I could do, 
and maybe we're both just fools,
 and I know

I'm never gonna change your mind
And we won't ever get this right
Never forget me, heaven accept me
Just let go, oh
I'm never gonna change your mind
And I won't ever treat you right
Never forget me, heaven accept me
I'll just go, goodbye...

Chasing that dopamine
Hope the champagne will wash
The pain away
When I wake up I'll need a new escape
Say it's the last time like I always do
Pick up the phone to make a random call
Can't stand the silence so I guess I'll talk
All of my friends they got the same issues
Every night distraction
Like a chemical reaction
We can't help ourselves

Losing my mind but I'm alright

 You turn your head and look away

 Been dancing 'round the feeling in the dark
 Can't get it out, why can't you tell me now

 Oh, I've been up all night wondering why you lied
 When your heart's saying more than you do
 I feel it every time that I look in your eyes
 Your heart ain't what I always knew

 And that's the truth
 And that's the truth
 And that's the truth
 And that's the truth

 On loop inside my head

 Might be your mistake

 If I don't ask, I'll never know

Won't have to drive too far
Just 'cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living

Driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk

And your arm felt nice 
wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling
I could be someone

He live with the bottle that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his

I said somebody's got to take care of him

363,Your Song (Cheat Codes Remix),Rita Ora(리타 오라)CONNECT 아티스트,"I woke up with a fear this morning
But I can taste you on the tip of my tongue
Alone without no warning
You're by my side and
we've got smoke in our lungs

Last night we were way up
kissing in the back of the cab
And then you say
love baby let's go back to my flat
And when we wake up
never had a feeling like that
I got a reason so man
put that record on again

I don't want to hear sad songs anymore
I only want to hear love songs
I found my heart up in this place tonight
Don't want to sing mad songs anymore
Only want to sing your song
Cause your song's got me feeling like I'm
Only want to sing your song
Cause your song's got me feeling like I'm
I'm in love I'm in love I'm in love
Yeah you know your song's got me
feeling like I'm

Yeah you know
Your song's got me feeling like I'm
Yeah you know
Your song's got me feeling like I'm
 
No fear but I think I'm falling
I'm not proud
But I'm usually the type of girl
that would hit and run
No risk so I think I'm all in
When I kiss your lips feel my heartbeat thump

And now we're way up
dancing on the roof of the house
And then we make love
right there on your best friend's couch
And then you say love this is what it's all about
So keep on kissing my mouth
and put that record on again

I don't want to hear sad songs anymore
I only want to hear love songs
I found my heart up in this place tonight
Don't want to sing mad songs anymore
Only want to sing your song
Cause your song's got me feeling like I'm
I'm in love I'm in love I'm in love
I'm in love I'm in love I'm in love

but it might take a while
I got my heart in my hands while 
my head's up in the clouds
And only heaven knows
if I will make it back to you

So I I just keep running
And I said oh
And only heaven knows
if I will make it back
Where the sand runs into the ocean's 
where I'll get lost
And let the raindrops fall
all around the castle of cards
Faced with the lions I felt the
courageleading my head
Cause even I know every battle 
leaves you with scars
So now I'm running like you set me 
free out in the wild
I know you want me to come home
but it might take a while
I got my heart in my hands while 
my head's up in the clouds

 You wait forever even if I don't
 Summer rain, sleepless nights

 When I feel like a castle in the sand
 And I fall down, you pick me up again
 When I can't find the answers in the wind
 And I falter, you pick me up again
 When I fall down you'll pick me up again

 When I fall down you'll pick me up again
 When I fall down you'll pick me up again

 From rising sea to setting sun
 We'll be together, forever young
 In the dead of night when thunder rolls
 Crawl under covers and hold me close

 In your arms now I'm found
 In your arms there's solid ground

 When I feel like a castle in the sand
 And I fall down, you pick me up again
 When I can't find the answers in the wind
 And I falter, you pick me up again
 When I fall down you'll pick me up again

 When I fall down you'll pick me up again

 You're all I need
 When I can't stand on my own two feet
 And I'm on my knees
 I know whenever I fall down you'll pick me up again

 When I fall down you'll pick me up again

Blink 182
So where are they
The ones that don't play
Smooth like Sade
Tell me
It's either up or we ain't goin' anywhere
And if they don't feel like the 90's
I don't care
Just a classic thing that lasts
Don't think that's too much to ask
If they don't got me
With my hands up in the air
They can find somebody else
They can find somebody else
Want a bandit
Tryna steal my heart
And never say goodbye
But like Alanis
It be so ironic
When they finally try
So where are they
That rock like Mötley
Smooth like Sade
Tell me (Tell me cuz)
It's either up or we ain't goin' anywhere
And if they don't feel like the 90's I don't care
Just a classic thing that lasts

I'll be there whenever you want me
Just say 'i love you even at your worst'

Why aren't you scared of me?
Do you feel comfy around me?

I want to change
It takes a little time.

But singing love forever
I never felt that ever

399,No Such Thing,John Mayer(존 메이어)CONNECT 아티스트,"""Welcome to the real world"", she said to me
Condescendingly
Take a seat
Take your life
Plot it out in black and white
Well I never lived the dreams of the prom kings
And the drama queens
I'd like to think the best of me
Is still hiding
Up my sleeve

They love to tell you
Stay inside the lines
But something's better
On the other side

I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above

So the good boys and girls take the so called right track
Faded white hats
Grabbing credits
Maybe transfers
They read all the books but they can't find the answers
And all of our parents
They're getting older
I wonder if they've wished for anything better
While in their memories
Tiny tragedies

They love to tell you
Stay inside the lines
But something's better
On the other side

I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you got to rise above

I am invincible
As long as I'm alive

I wanna run through the halls of my high school
I wanna scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above

I just can't wait til my 10 year reunion
I'm gonna bust down the double doors
And when I stand on these tables before you
You will know what all this time was for"

I felt secure and slept inside her arms

She promised me

That she would always love me unconiditionally

And i held onto her fingertips

Flipping over years of past

Old pictures black and white

Recalling all the memories

Oh take me back

Take me back

Emotions taking over me

Crying tears of gratitude

Missing all the memories

Oh take me back

Take me back

If i could go back in time

If i could change my past

I would right all my wrongs

I would love with all i have

If i could go back even

If i could change my past

I will always be your firends

'Cuz you are my favourite memories

When i was nine my papa took me fishing

We caught nothing but it brought us closer

Its all i wanted

Early morning instant ramen

Slurping noodles as we watching the rising morning sun

Flipping over years of past

Old picture black and white

Recalling all the memories

Oh take me back

Take me back

Emotions taking over me

Crying tears of gratitude

Missing all the memories

Oh take me back

Take me back

Twenty years from now

Will i still be here

Will i be living life that i dreamed to be

Forty years from now

Will i still be me

Theres too many questions i cant think straight

But even through the storms

You know ill be there

I promise that ill hold you no matter what

Im missing all the memories

Oh take me

Take me

Take me back

If i could go back in time

If i could change my past

I would right all my wrongs

I would love with all i have

If i could go back even

If i could change my past

Why can't we not simplify?
Just let it go and try
Shall we make shall we make the move?

Shall we make shall we make the move?
Shall we make shall we make the move?

There's nothing on the line to compromise

To fight this winder day
Broken hearted I've been

I'll spend the holiday
Inside these sapphire waves
As the sunset's sinking away
Light the night
Starry eyed
Wave goodbye
So long this might be the year
I will fall in love with the one
My heart's dreaming of
Shallow glasses breaking
Though longing never ends
Letting go of ways that need a change
Still I pretend
I've got an island in my back pocket
Looking for a way to find love any day
I'll spend the holiday
Inside these sapphire waves
As the sunset's surfing away
Light the night
Starry eyed
Wave goodbye
So long this might be the year
I will fall in love with the one

To find the tears fallen from
Everything my heart could dream of"

A rocky heart for breaking teeth
And apple cores cyanide seed

All this rotting fruit with you
It's been a long season through
All this rotting fruit with you

Lift back and see the darkness hid
Swallowed up an angled in
Looking back at sweetness dim
Ripe June had leaf and shady friend
The cool air is gone again

Dear jean
I hope this doesn't come as a surprise
But I've fallen for a woman from the skies
And she be truer than the lies
Truer than the prize
And you can see it
When you look into her eyes
Deep blue like the flicker of the flame
'Fore it dies
But this ain't dying it's rising
Like the big round orange on horizon
I know it means I'm not about as much
But listen I ain't moving out as such
Just moving half my clothes
Maybe louder stuff
Out the south out the house
Never out of touch
Trust I don't think I said it loud enough
I'm out the south out the house
Never out of touch
Trust out of sight never out of mind
Out the light never out of line
Trust another night running out of time
Let it shine like we're living in a pantomime
She's not behind me or behind you
But beside we and beside two
But behind these little lines true
That I scribble in a book
Think she idolizes you
So one night I'll be saying I do
To a girl that can read my mind too
With little ryan sat in a white suit
With my own baby jean sat to his right too
I had a dream and it came true
And I can only blame you
Shit I can only blame you
I guess you came through"

And while we don't have all the answers
We still know what truly matters
Keeping hope alive despite
The darkest storm
The days are drifting slowly by

Turn the lights around me down
Take the slow way
Round the center of the sun
Trying to steal the day
Maybe to be with you
Do you still remember my name
Do you feel the same
Do the things I say make you laugh
Just a laugh from yesterday
Gonna make this love
Don't know where to go but I'm running
I'm gonna make this love
Don't know how to fly but we're soaring
This is the love I need
This is the love keeping me real
This is the love that I know
It had to be you
It's getting late
When the crowds all start to go
We take the long way
To the corner of the sky
Where you can be with me
Leaving the world below
Will you still remember my name
Will we feel the same
Will the things I say make you laugh

So how am I supposed to feel when
You said, ""It's so real,"" to my face?

But a promise never stays
So how am I supposed to act when
It's just how it is nowadays?


And I swear, we kinda fell in love with the pain
And I'm scared we don't even know the right way


Wish I loved you in the 90s
'Cause I know that we would work
Say wrong place, wrong time
Should've been alive
Bet it wouldn't hurt
If I had loved you in the 90s
Back when life wasn't a blur
Say right guy, right vibe
Wouldn't have to try
Bet it wouldn't hurt
If I had loved you in the 90s
If I had lovеd you in the 90s


What happened to thе guy picking up the girl?
And now you speed down the highway
And don't care to say a word
And my head is kinda dreamy
I imagine it with you
I'm alone, record on
Lookin' at this guy like '92, oh-oh-ooh

It's kinda funny how I paid for college when Youtube was an option
But then I would've had to spend my best years
Skipping ads and reading comments
And when the hell did advertisements get so good, they're like narcotics
So now I'm spending every penny I own
I should've allotted to finish in college

It's kinda funny how I keep debating
If someone's shy or if they hate me
I feel like everyone I know right now
Is hooking up and getting wasted (Without me)
And maybe sex is overrated but we're too shy to ever say it
So we pretend we're all amazing
It's 3 am I should be sleeping

Would you go running if you saw the real me?
Maybe you'd love 'em
Yeah, maybe you'd feel me
But I'll never ask you, no that's super scary
Sorry to bail, it's already 3 o'clock
It's too hard to tell if anything's real or not

It's kinda funny how you vote for someone
To vote for someone, to vote for someone
And you might end up with someone evil, but you say that he means well
If I keep on talking politics, my friends will dip, they're over it
If I keep on talking politics, I'm Hamilton (without the hits)

Would you go running if you saw the real me?

Isn't this obvious, am I insane?
Let's blame our parents 'cause they taught us their ways
Stay out of politics, stay on the fence
Stay out of all of it to keep half your fans
Isn't this obvious, am I insane?

That if you're fucking racist then don't come to my show

Into something that reminds you of her
No I don't need your previous logistics
Where you spent your last Christmas
Spare your past life specifics oh
And when your friends tell stories about 2023
I hope they hardly can recall
There was a you without a me
Wish I could be blissfully unaware of

475,Flicker,Niall Horan(나일 호란),"When you feel your love's been taken
 When you know there's something missing
 In the dark, we're barely hangin' on
 Then you rest your head upon my chest
 And you feel like there ain't nothing left
 I'm afraid that what we had is gone

 Then I think of the start
 And it echoes a spark
 And I remember the magic electricity
 Then I look in my heart
 There's a light in the dark
 Still a flicker of hope that you first gave to me
 That I wanna keep
 Please don't leave
 Please don't leave

 When you lay there and you're sleeping
 Hear the patterns of your breathing
 And I tell you things you've never heard before
 Asking questions to the ceiling
 Never knowing what you're thinking
 I'm afraid that what we had is gone

 Then I think of the start
 And it echoes a spark
 And I remember the magic electricity
 Then I look in my heart
 There's a light in the dark
 Still a flicker of hope that you first gave to me
 That I wanna keep
 Please don't leave
 Please don't leave

 And I want this to pass
 And I hope this won't last
 Last too long

 Then I think of the start
 And it echoes a spark
 And I remember the magic electricity
 Then I look in my heart
 There's a light in the dark
 Still a flicker of hope that you first gave to me
 That I wanna keep

Would you run up the bag if I needed you to?

Would you do for me too?
Dark nights we had some dark nights
Baby now I I can't see the lines
Going a hunned and five miles
In a twenty mile lane

478,Can't Look Back,Mat Kearney(맷 카니),"I was on a train out of New Mexico
Looking for a flame for my heart of coal
Sold my Nikon lens to get outta town
Don't know how deep you're in 'til you're tryna get out
She was floating like a vision down through the aisle
Mississippi queen with a Tennessee smile
The smell of cheap coffee and Jamaican rum
We watched the desert fade in the Santa Fe sun

I said I'm not feelin' right
She said, ""Boy you'll be just fine
Go ahead and rest your eyes""


'Cause you can't look back (Can't look back)
You can't look back (Can't look back)
There ain't no future in the past
And you can't look back (Can't look back)


With characters galore in the Sayulita sun
Pinеapple pastor with the señoritas
All thе disenfranchised kids in the room
We were baptized in the Pacific moon
Someone put a cactus up to my tongue
You can feel alive and try callin' it love
A boy with a smile handed me his keys
Said, ""Go ahead and try but you'll never leave""


Someone was singin' a hymn
And the moon, it started to spin
So I jump right in


Singin' can't look back (Can't look back)
You can't look back (Can't look back)
There ain't no future in the past
And you can't look back (Can't look back)


The years go by like you never planned
I had missed a flight out of Birmingham
The way her yellow apron walked in the room
There was no mistake in the way that she moved
This is my boy and this is my girl
Yeah, I'll be employed 'til the end of the world
Somewhere tonight on the westbound train
I know there's wild hearts just runnin' away

That sounded just like a dream
One she's still singing to me
It was so bittersweet

Because you can't look back (Can't look back)
You can't look back (Can't look back)
There ain't no future in the past
And you can't go back (Can't look back)
You can't look back (Can't look back)
You can't go back (Can't look back)
There ain't no future in the past

한없이 위로한 채 이 밤을 보내네
십오야 둥근 달아 구름 속에 잠겼느냐
휘영청 밝은 달아 나도 함께 비춰주오
수많은 별들 속에 포근히 감싸주오
십오야 둥근 달아 구름 속에 잠겼느냐
휘영청 밝은 달아 나도 함께 비춰주오
수많은 별들 속에 포근히 감싸주오

한숨처럼 깊기만 한데
마음은 동산에 뛰노네

495,너로 가득한 순간,빌리어코스티CONNECT 아티스트,"스쳐 가는 바람이 
다가오는 시간이
그대 앞에 서는 날 
기다리고 있죠

조용히 두 눈을 감고
네 생각에 잠기면
잡힐 듯이 가까이
내게 다가오는 너

따듯한 너의 목소리
꿈 같던 그 시간 속에
여전한 미소 넌 그대로인걸

이만큼의 시간들과
너 없는 날의 외로움
약속도 없는 기다림으로
널 만나게 되면
내 품 안에 너를 안고서
다시는 놓치지 않을
너로 가득한 이 모든 순간들

그 작은 미소만으로
알아챌 수 있었던
너와의 시간들이
시작되는 이 순간

조금만 더 네게 가까이
꿈 같던 그 시간 속에
여전한 미소 넌 그대로인걸

이만큼의 시간들과
너 없는 날의 외로움
약속도 없는 기다림으로
널 만나게 되면

내 품 안에 너를 안고서
다시는 놓치지 않을
너로 가득한 이 모든 순간들
 
내 품 안에 너를 안고서
다시는 놓치지 않을
너로 가득한 이 모든 순간들"

This is our place we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze
And mysterious way about you dear
Have I known you twenty seconds
Or twenty years?
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close
Forever and ever?
And oh take me out and take me home
You're my my my my

We could let our friends crash
In the living room
This is our place we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious
That everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now honey
But I want 'em all
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close
Forever and ever?
And oh take me out and take me home
You're my my my my
Lover
Ladies and gentlemen
Will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of
A man to be my
Lover
My heart's been borrowed
And yours has been blue
All's well it ends well to end up with you
Swear to be over dramatic and true to my
Lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table I'll save you a seat

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?

open up my eyes
Well its fine by me

All this time I was finding myself
And I didn’t know I was lost

When I’m wiser and I’m older

And I didn’t know I was lost

I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
I hope I get the chance 
to travel the world
I don’t have any plans
Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life’s a game made for everyone
And love is the prize

To stay here in the moment
Leave the rest unspoken

I'm afraid they're gonna scare ya
So I keep 'em in my mind
So what would happen if I surrender
Would you catch me if I fall
Are we stuck like this forever

One more dance
One more night
One more touch
Maybe it will make us fall in love
Give it time
To make it feel right
Don't give up
Maybe it would make us fall in love

Bottles of wine
Are empty on the floor like so many times before
Oh, how far can we go
Before we hit cold ground
And all the candles burn down

So what would happen if I surrender
Would you catch me if I fall
Are we stuck like this forever

We both wanna slide

We both wanna argue until we're both right

No medicine is fixing us

Can't tell you why but tell you what

I might be better on my own

I wish I never met your ass

Wasn't even supposed to be witcha'

Yeah, and it gets crazy in the night

I cannot sleep with you

And I could keep you nice and warm

Won't do no thinking, I'm in love

If I was to give you the world

That's anything that you can think of


Got too much going to be upset

I swear I'd rather be your friend

Summer in the back of your car
Singing Drake in the dark

I can't help but think about you
And the way that it was
I wish I could let go of us
It's been way too long
Oh it's been way too long
Oh
Oh it's been way too long
Been way too long
Since you've been gone
Its been way too long come see me please
She said its way too long she can't handle me
Know your a good girl be bad for me
My money pretty like Anne Marie
Dont want 1 wife trying to marry 3
Forget quality I want quantity
If you done me wrong don't bother me
Forget sorry no apologies
I like your style can you wind me for
Do that same dance as Cardi B (Bardi)
I can't lie man I need you girl
No im joking I need a deal
Or even Mabels good for me
Just fun no label that's good for me
Whose the chick I need hmm
Its Jade from Little Mix for me
What you saying B

Oh it's been way too long

Damn we made it so far
Red eyes from the red light
And that just set the mood
You say you're obsessed with me
So I took a second and I said Me too
I'm obsessed with me e e as much as you
Say you'd die for me I'd die for me e too
And if I lost you I'd still have me I can't lose
When you say
That you're obsessed with me me too
I did my hair like waves on the beach
This dress so tight you can't even speak
My heels so high might get a nosebleed
Music's so loud but I hear your heartbeat

511,Stronger (feat. Kesha),Sam Feldt(샘 펠트),"I find my way through the darkness
 A battle heart, that's how I'm made
 And I may not heal from all these bruises
 But I'll better off this way

 So it rushes in like I'm oil to water
 Think it's time to change when you don't wanna
 Don't be afraid when the pain falls on ya
 Let it wash away all the hate all on your shoulders

 You gotta take it day-by-day
 Keep moving forward no matter what they say
 And when the thieves try to steal your faith
 Keep pushin' through 'em 'cause there ain't no other way
 If you wanna get stronger

 No, we don't break, no, we don't break

 I've been on the brink of broken
 Stripped of my shadow on the floor
 Like the broken bones inside my body
 I'm almost stronger than before

 You gotta take it day-by-day
 Keep moving forward no matter what they say

 Keep pushin' through 'em 'cause there ain't no other way

I realize I never had that much to lose to lose
Show me you can be
More than just my enemy
One day you and me
We can live our fantasies
I want to believe
We can rule the galaxy
Move on from insanity

We were so damn close

There goes another one on my blacklist
Two second loves becoming a habit
There goes another one that's the damage
Bang bang bang (Bang bang bang)

I met a boy online
On the first night
We were talking like we clicked
Yeah he was Beiber fine
Baggy jeans and got a tattoo on his neck
Maybe you're the one
That all my friends finally love
Or maybe its a mission
And you'll never get along
But I think this time
I'll be falling for you every single week
For a second I was choosing team cupid
We were so damn close

 Wish that I could put my finger on a moment that went wrong
 But sometimes it's just a feeling
 And I think we've hit the ceiling

 Could be holding on 'til it all goes wrong
 Saying things I don't wanna say
 Before we mess up we should stop
 I wanna remember you this way

 So I let you go
 And we can keep it chapter on a pedestal
 Let's let it go
 And leave it beautiful

 Maybe we'll find someone better
 Let's decide to swallow pride and hope the best is yet to come
 We always talked about forever
 But you know nothing lasts forever

 Could be holding on 'til it all goes wrong
 Saying things I don't wanna say
 Before we mess up we should stop
 I wanna remember you this way

 So I let you go
 And we can keep it chapter on a pedestal
 Let's let it go
 And leave it beautiful
 Leave it beautiful

 To moments that we had when
 We were so in love
 I don't want them to vanish

Ride high on the day
I've been away so long
It's been nice getting to know you
Well as it seems I was seventeen
When I first let out on a bike ride
Hit the brakes now I'm wide awake
Was it just a matter of time
A year ago
Can't believe that
I was spinning out of control
Gone away as a wild wave
Ride high on the day
Out on an ocean liner
It's been hard seeing you go
Well as for me I was seventeen
When my first true love broke
Into my heart
Castaway where I've lived for days
On an island now drifting us apart
Still here I go
Best believe there's not a day
I don't look back on"

TVs selling what you can get
She laughs nowhere as pretty as this.
Green cars crawling in the slow lane
Lost stars waiting for the dark train
She smiles, turns and blows the city a kiss.

Under the waves I feel her pull my body down
Under the waves she takes me
where I wanna drown
Ah, gimme miles away she calls to me
This girl is a beautiful sea.

Freeze frame, graffiti at the bus stop
Star Wars, chewing gum and punk rock
She says, ""What d'you say we give this a miss?""
Let's go, take you where the wind blows
Sail ships far into tomorrow
We can turn and blow the city a kiss.


Under the waves I feel her pull my body down
Under the waves she takes me
where I wanna drown
Ah, gimme miles away she calls my name
She gets into my veins
And writes my poetry
This girl is a beautiful sea
The girl is a beautiful sea
This girl is a beautiful sea

And you're crying there's no place to start

Are handing out bunches kissing on mouth
Baby don't you go and caught in the bleachers
Baby don't you go and get stuck in the house
All the good kids with the bright red cheeks
Are handing out bunches kissing on mouth
In the backyard where you sink and I swim
Took me all night just to convince you
To dive while you hold both my hands
But you let me go when feet touch the surface
In the morning your hair is still damp
And you're sleeping our pillows are stamped
With the chlorine that's itching my skin
Still you' let me go and feet touch the surface

Sipping tea in a bar by the roadside

Don't you let those other boys fool you
Gotta love that awful hairdo

I thought that I was stronger
When you gonna realise
That you don't even have to try any longer?
Do what you want to

That someday it would live me back to you
That someday it would live me back to you

Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave
Fingers trace your every outline
Paint a picture with my hands
Back and forth we sway
like branches in a storm
Change the weather
still together when it ends

In darkness she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave
But things just get so crazy living

Tired and lonely
With no real place to stay

When I had this crazy dream
Of waking up
In your house
On a san francisco street
We tune out all the nasty weather
And it's all in front of you and me
You were intriguing
Just looking at a magazine
Like when I first saw you
Back in two thousand and three
Then you walked over
Said: ‘you don't have to be alone’
I don't have a crystal ball
There's no way that I could've known
(I'd be) waking up
In your house
On a san francisco street
We tune out all the nasty weather
And it's all in front of you and me
Waking up
In your house
On a san francisco street
We tune out all the nasty weather
And it's all in front of you

She holds you captivated in her palm 

Suddenly I see 
This is what I wanna be 
Suddenly I see 
Why the hell it means so much to me 

I feel like walking the world 
Like walking the world 
You can hear she's a beautiful girl 
She's a beautiful girl 
She fills up every corner like she's born in black and white 
Makes you feel warmer when you're trying to remember 
What you heard 
She likes to leave you hanging on a wire 

Suddenly I see 

And she's taller than most 
And she's looking at me 
I can see her eyes looking from a page in a magazine 
Oh she makes me feel like I could be a tower 
A big strong tower 
She got the power to be 
The power to give 
The power to see 

Suddenly I see 

Suddenly I see 
This is what I wanna be 
Suddenly I see 
Why the hell it means so much to me"

599,Only The Young (Featured in Miss Americana),Taylor Swift(테일러 스위프트),"It keeps me awake the look on your face
The moment you heard the news
You're screaming inside and frozen in time
You did all that you could do
The game was rigged the ref got tricked
The wrong ones think they're right
You were outnumbered this time
But only the young only the young
Only the young only the young
Can run
Can run
So run and run and run
So every day now
You brace for the sound
You've only heard on TV
You go to class scared
Wondering where the best
Hiding spot would be
And the big bad man and his big bad clan
Their hands are stained with red
Oh how quickly they forget
They aren't gonna help us
Too busy helping themselves
They aren't gonna change this
We gotta do it ourselves
They think that it's over
But it's just begun
Only one thing can save us
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young
Only the young
(Don't say you're too tired to fight)
Only the young
(It's just a matter of time)
Only the young
(Up there's the finish line)
Only the young
Can run
Don't say you're too tired to fight
It's just a matter of time (Can run)
Up there's the finish line
(So run and run and run)
Don't say you're too tired to fight
It's just a matter of time (So run)
Up there's the finish line

600,How Far I'll Go,Auli'i Cravalho,"I've been staring at the edge of the water
Long as I can remember, 
never really knowing why
I wish I could be the perfect daughter
But I come back to the water, 
no matter how hard I try

Every turn I take, every trail I track
Every path I make, every road leads back
To the place I know where I cannot go
Where I long to be

See the line where the sky meets the sea? 
It calls me
And no one knows, how far it goes
If the wind in my sail 
on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know
If I go there's just no telling how far I'll go

I know everybody on this island 
seems so happy, on this island
Everything is by design
I know everybody on this island 
has a role, on this island
So maybe I can roll with mine

I can lead with pride, I can make us strong
I'll be satisfied if I play along
But the voice inside sings a different song
What is wrong with me?

See the light as it shines on the sea? 
It's blinding
But no one knows, how deep it goes
And it seems like it's calling out to me, 
so come find me
And let me know
What's beyond that line, 
will I cross that line?

See the line where the sky meets the sea?
It calls me
And no one knows, how far it goes
If the wind in my sail 
on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know
How far I'll go"

But suddenly it must come to an end
Stop smiling, you know you are so annoying

If she really finds out I'll be dead man walkin'
Your eyes are blue
So good to be true
I just can't stop thinkin' about you, oh
Though we're a far apart
You are still my best bud
So here we go again, I fall in love again
Please don't tell that we're gonna be friend
Your love is sweet as honey in the spring
Romantic places, you will be the clue
This time love you'll always in my dream
It's early, too early
It comes too early
It's easy to remember
But, so hard to forget
Oh, here we go again, I kissed that girl again
Then suddenly it must come to an end
Stop smiling, you know you're so annoying

I think that you are dope

But I think you're something new
Don't you let them bother you
With their futile frail opinions
I think you're really one of a kind
You're one of a kind
I think you're really good
At doing what you do
Beautiful as the sky even if you feel blue
A fly soul you got it
I think I feel grounded 'cause you're so solid
And nobody
Nobody can take your shine away
I got a bone to pick
'Cause many want a counterfeit
'Cause many want another hit
Of beauty in a tighter fit
Escape inside the visual
The money and the physical
Stuck inside the visible
It's lookin' like a ritual
If you only felt what I feel about you
Then maybe you wouldn't need
What they say you do
And I see you fightin' tooth and nail
I hope it all goes well
And I hope that you feel it now
That you're worth much
More than you think

I think you're really one of a kind
You're one of a kind
Aw yea just one of a kind
And you can't say nothin' else
You're the star in your movie
And I don't take it lightly
You gotta give yourself more credit
For all that you've done
For all the little battles you've won
So sit back relax you've earned it
No need for stress 'cause you're worth it
I'll take care of the rest
And I wanna say well done well done
And I hope that you feel it now

There is nobody like you in the world
So special
So beautiful
So wonderful
So precious
So lovely
So worthy

Feel the winters getting colder
Used to play out in the snow
Now I stay inside my home
I want to be a better man but act like I'm still a kid
Never had a backup plan, never had that many friends
I want it back, want it back, playing in the cul de sac
Everything was fun and games till grandpa had a heart attack
Mama had a drinkin' problem, daddy don't know how to act
But I'd rather have issues
Than ""I miss yous"" when they're gone and that's why
And I don't wanna grow old
Scared to watch the time go

Hurt ourselves taking pain pills

Now I'm sippin' on rum and tequila, tryna numb all the pain

Hoppin' in my Jeep, got no destination
Vibin' like we used to before you were taken
Scroll through my feed, heard 'bout your engagement
Sorry, I forgot to post congratulations
And now I daydream, pretending nothing is wrong
And I've been faking like I don't wanna call
When I was faded, I saw your mom at the mall
And she said I should move on because her baby moved on

Warning me to keep up my guard, but each time I forget it

It's a bit out of character for me
Fuck what they're saying, my mind ain't changing
Weighed it all up and I know the dangers
Know I got you and know you got me
That's all that we need, we're running off fumes
I know, I won't let you go

My old friend
Nights that you would hold me
I ain't gone pretend that I
Didn't want you here
When I felt like no one cared
You were there
Dear Depression
How you been
Heavy like a blanket
All tucked in
I could stay in the dark
Hiding my broken heart
But then a light came on
Staying comfortable
Was a lie I've been sold
And what I thought was love
I was just cold
Think it's time to say
Bye bye this one last time
Too late
Not gonna change my mind
Get outta my way
Moving forward no rewind
Too Late
No more baby
No way
It's time to say bye bye
Dear Anxiety
Let me be
All the things I should've done
Could've done
You won't get the best of me this time
I was made for more by design
Sick and tired of watching everyone's feed
Experiencing life vicariously
Think it's time to say
Bye bye this one last time
Too late
Not gonna change my mind
Get outta my way
Moving forward no rewind
Too Late
No more baby
No way
It's time to say bye bye
Bye bye this one last time
Too late
Not gonna change my mind
Get outta my way
Moving forward no rewind
Too Late
No more baby
No way
It's time to say bye bye
It won't be easy no
But the world needs
What you've hidden away
Farewell to shame and fear
Don't wait up for the new year
Start today

Bye bye this one last time
Too late
Not gonna change my mind
Get outta my way
Moving forward no rewind

616,October,Alessia Cara(알레시아 카라),"5 a.m. the moon went to sleep, yeah
 Friends speaking in tongues in the backseat
 Just one little glance, I know what you mean, somehow

 We're stealing moments, moments away
 Why are we just not as good in the day?
 Is it too soon to know if it's too soon to say, for now?

 The bubble we're living in, setting me free again
 I don't know what it is about this
 I'm gonna miss it when it's over, yeah yeah
 I hope we never see October, yeah yeah
 I felt the weight fall off my shoulders, yeah yeah
 I'm gonna miss this when it's
 I'm gonna miss you when it's done

 Can't feel my hands, you laugh like you do
 It happened like that, according to you
 It's only a month but doesn't feel new somehow

 Yeah, yeah the bubble we're living in, setting me free again
 I don't know what it is about this
 I'm gonna miss it when it's over, yeah yeah
 I hope we never see October, yeah yeah
 I felt the weight fall off my shoulders, yeah yeah
 I'm gonna miss this when it's
 I'm gonna miss, I'm gonna miss it when it's over, yeah yeah
 I hope we never see October, yeah yeah
 I felt the weight fall off my shoulders, yeah yeah
 I'm gonna miss this when it's
 I'm gonna miss you when it's done

 Paint a picture in my brain
 Encapsulate the fleeting feeling
 It ricochets, replays my pain, till every trace is leaving
 The love of autumn-time days flying by
 Every sunrise healing me
 And we're okay, we'll live this way till it's done

 I'm gonna miss this when it's over
 I hope we never see October
 I felt the weight fall off my shoulders, yeah yeah
 I'm gonna miss this when it's
 I'm gonna miss, I'm gonna miss this when it's over, yeah yeah
 I hope we never see October, yeah yeah
 I felt the weight fall off my shoulders, yeah yeah
 I'm gonna miss this when it's
 I'm gonna miss you when it's done"
617,Palm Springs (the way you made me feel),Virginia To Vegas(버지니아 투 베가스),"I hate the part of me that still loves you
I still see you in my dreams and everything I do
Wanna call you every single time I've had a few
When I met you, we were...

Sun drunk sippin in a pool side bar
We got kissin in an old golf cart
Told you that I loved you in the first 5 minutes
If love was an ocean we were both jumpin in it
Couldn't stop laughing when we both got caught
Smoking marijuana in the bathroom stall
Sleepin by the fire with your head on my shoulder

The way you made me feel (ya ya ya ya)
I know it was real... (ya ya ya ya)
The way you made me feel (ya ya ya ya)
I know it was real, I know it was real...

I, miss the way you used to say my name
I miss Dirty Dancing with you in the desert rain
You looked at me and damn you took my breath away
I still think about the day, we were...

Singing karaoke underneath the stars
Reposado out the bottle tryna find mars
Girl you had me higher than the satellite dishes
Woke up in the morning we were naked in the kitchen singin'
Sha-la-la-la-la, Sha-la-la-la-la
La-ta-di-da, La-ta-di-da

The way you made me feel (ya ya ya ya)
I know it was real... (ya ya ya ya)
The way you made me feel (ya ya ya ya)
I know it was real, I know it was real...

Even though our love is over now...
Baby you're still all I think about (like all the time)
Even though we're both so far apart (so far, so far)
Baby you know you still got my heart

The way you made me feel (ya ya ya ya)
I know it was real... (ya ya ya ya)
The way you made me feel (ya ya ya ya)
I know it was real, I know it was real..."
618,Sunny Afternoon,Benny Sings(베니 싱스),"I love October
Here where the rhythm don't stop
You know love is right around the corner
Night vision colours fading in me
All I know is getting things in order
It's a sunny afternoon but I need you here
I'm nothing without you
It's a sunny afternoon but I'm freezing here
I'll be coming back real soon
You are soft spoken
I can't believe it's all gone
You know love is right there
Where you make it
Just know that you've got a friend in me
So come on it's time to celebrate it
It's a sunny afternoon but I need you here
I'm nothing without you
It's a sunny afternoon but I'm freezing here
I'll be coming back real soon
It's so special
And I don't wanna make a fuss
You'll have to leave
It's better for the both of us
Sunny afternoon my baby girl
Sunny afternoon baby girl
Sunny afternoon ooh la
It's a sunny afternoon my baby girl"
620,Citrus,Sylo,"Been touching road
Never stay home
Off to reach another million
Miles a minute
Fighting gets old blow up my phone
I don’t wanna reach the ceiling
No, I ain’t willing

My momma told me to fake it
If I don’t know what to say
Making these walls out of pavement
If it’s what we need that’s one thing

Why you so sour you like citrus
We so apart by only inches
You wrapped my head up with these switches
Why you so sour you like citrus
Just confess
That you like to do this to me
Can’t you see in my eyes I’m broken
Gonna have to take back those keys
Please make this еasy

Our roads unknown ain’t personal
Know you’ve been up on your feelings
What’s the sеquel
Give me some more sugar before
We go back the way we’re used to
I wanna veto

My mama told me to leave it
If I know that I can’t stay
Making these walls out of pavement
If its what we need that’s one thing

Why you so sour you like citrus
We so apart by only inches
You wrapped my head up with these switches
Why you so sour you like citrus
Just confess
That you like to do this to me
Can’t you see in my eyes I’m broken
Gonna have to take back those keys
Please make this easy"
621,If We'd Never Met,Gabe Bondoc,"If we'd never met I'd probably be
Wandering aimlessly if we'd never met
This life no I just wouldn't get
What I wanted out of it
If we'd never
If we'd never met
My hopes and my dreams
They'd all be just beyond my reach
If we'd never met
Oh it would be so hard to believe
How easy love could be
If we'd never met
I hope you feel the same way I do
But even if you don't
I can't say I blame you
Cause I'm the crazy one
You're the amazing one
And you're the only one
I've ever given my heart to
So if we'd never
If we'd never met
My heart would go bad
Expiring without your hand
Oh we'd never met
My love would sit high on the shelf
Just singing to himself
If we'd never met
I hope you feel the same way I do
But even if you don't
I can't say I blame you
Cause I'm the crazy one
You're the amazing one
And you're the only one
I've ever given my heart to
So if we'd never met
If we had never met
Life would be colorless
I doubt that I could ever love another
No one but you
I'm glad we met aren't you?
If we'd had never met
Life would be colorless
I doubt that I could ever love another
No one but you
I'm glad we met aren't you?

And we kiss in public just to prove it
And I don't wanna feel that way

Live it up you fake

어쩌면 그렇게 아프게 웃을까
가만히 널 바라보다
난 말야 되고픈 게 많아져
내가 너의 곁이 될 수 있다면
너의 모든 밤과 모든 낮에
그냥 함께할 수 있다면
숨을 쉴 때마다 나아질 텐데
걷는 걸음마다 좋을 텐데
아파도 그곳이 니 곁이라면
쉽지 않은 곳이라는 걸
알아도 가고 싶은 걸
저만치 너란 길은 너무 예뻐서
한 발짝 다가서면 한 발짝 뒷걸음쳐
너무 빛나는 건 자꾸 날 서성거리게 해
나누고 싶은 건 너의 그 슬픔들
가만히 널 떠올리면
난 말야 하고픈 게 많아져
하루 종일 너를 바라봤으면
한순간도 놓치지 않도록
니가 나의 세상이니까
눈을 깜빡일 때마다 그리워
고개 돌릴 때마다 생각나
니가 있는 곳에 나도 있다면
첨으로 지키고 싶은 게 생겨
잠시 너를 안고 있으면 말야
내가 너의 곁이 될 수 있다면
너의 모든 밤과 모든 낮에
그냥 함께할 수 있다면

In my feelings more than drake so yeah
Your name on my lips tongue tied
Free rent living in my mind

One magical night
I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me

And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn't love it isn't hate
It's just indifference
I forgot that you
Got out some popcorn
As soon as my rep started
Going down down down
Laughed on the school yard
As soon as I tripped up
And hit the ground ground ground
And I would've stuck around for ya
Would've fought the whole town so yeah
Would've been right there front row
Even if nobody came to your show
But you showed who you are
Then one magical night
I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me
But it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn't love it isn't hate

Sent me a clear message
Taught me some hard lessons
I just forget what they were
It's all just a blur
I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me
But it didn't

A melody that's singing you're not fine

We can talk all night

757,parking lot view,almost monday,"Man I just slept on a couch
Wake up to heat in the south (Yeah)
And I got a long night ahead (Okay)
Sharing a room with my friends
(Room with my friends)
Shower then head to the pool
Wonder what they doing at school
I hope that they think that I'm cool
Told them the road came for free
But nothing is free
So I wait wait wait
Seattle to New York City
I know that something is missing
It's just another hotel room without you
Feels like I'm watching an eternal
Infomercial come through
My hotel room parking lot view
This California King needs a queen
And baby that's you
Check out my parking lot view
My window got smashed in
Insurance I cashed in
But I'm doing fine I'm walking the line
Just like Johnny Cash did
I wanna be massive
Play to the masses
But it's hard to flex
When your Yeezys are fake
And your gold chains are plastic
So I wait wait wait
London to Paris I'm dreaming
I'd take you with me believe it
But I'm still in a hotel room without you
Feels like I'm watching an eternal
Infomercial come through
My hotel room parking lot view
This California King needs a queen
And baby that's you
Check out my parking lot view
Check out my parking lot view
Feels like I'm watching
Watching an infomercial come through
My hotel room girl
It's just another it's just another
It's just another hotel room without you
Feels like I'm watching an eternal

759,Hate Me Too,Emily Burns,"Friday night falls
Rolling into bars in the heart of soho
Just one phone call
And I'm right back in
No I just can't say no
And I won't tell anybody
Where I'm going tonight
Say I drank a little much
And I do my goodbyes
I'm wasted
But I'm not wasted
And I'll find the blue door
At the end of your street
And I'll do the same knock
So you know that it's me
Wait patiently
And you hold my hand in the street light
And you kiss my lips and it feels right
When you hit me hard with the goodbye
We know I'll be back again

When you come round
Just to set me up for a breakdown
And I let you do it
You know hate you but I hate me too

Yeah I hate you but I hate me
(Let you do it)
You know I hate you but I hate me

Not a word's been said
We go back to strangers
And I'm doing just fine
I got you out my head
Haven't cried in ages
But when you call me up late
In the dead of the night
And you use the same lines
That I hear every time
You need me
God I'm so easy
So I find the blue door
At the end of your street
And I do the same knock
Wait patiently
And you hold my hand in the street light
And you kiss my lips
When you hit me hard with the goodbye
We know ill be back again
'Cause it feels so good
When you come 'round
Just to set me up for a breakdown
And I let you do it
You know hate you
But I hate me
Standing at your doorstep
Wondering why I'm here again
You know that I hate you
You know that I hate me
You won't ever love me
But tonight let's just pretend
You know that I hate you
You you you you you you
And you hold my hand in the street light
And you kiss my lips and it feels right
When you hit me hard with the goodbye
We know I'll be back again

One kiss I'm addicted
One drink and it's sink or swim
I'm feeling vulnerable
What if I let go
You make me want to though
The thing about love
It ain't simple enough
The thing about trust is
It takes two of us
So if I let you win it tonight
Hundred degrees know you want to
But please don't touch me
If you don't mean it
The space between our skin
Saying more than enough
But once you lay a finger
It can't be undone
So please don't touch me
If you don't mean it
I wonder how it's been
Yeah I've been through a lot
But once you put your hands
It can't be undone
So please don't touch me
If you don't mean it
Touch me
If you don't mean it
Two nights in a row now
I brought you back to mine
Three words getting closer
Say enough I'll lose my mind
I'm feeling vulnerable
What if I let go
You make me want to though
The thing about love
It ain't simple enough
The thing about trust is
It takes two of us

Want to be calling you
3 AM begging you baby to love me again

We can get lost in things that we make for days
In the blackest nights
But there in the dark you found that
The stars are
Shinning their brightest light

Your tides, they pull me back to sea
When you bite on my lip
And hold my hand, 
and moan again, I'ma hold that ass
When you kiss on my lips
And hold my hand, 
and moan again, I'ma hold that ass

You don't know, I've been missin' you

797,Sharpest Edges,Gallant(갈란트),"They said a little bit of you was all I needed
But they didn't tell that one step closer to you
Is a step closer to my grave
Now I find myself trying to save myself
By nearly killing myself
Every time I get closer to you babe
Is that lipstick or blood on those lips?
The berry is sweeter on your darker side
And each time we do it
You're closer to mine
You're broken in places
That don't see the light
But that doesn't stop me
From spending the night
You got the sharpest edges I've ever seen
And every time my hands get careless
You make me bleed
I'm cut up down and in between
'Cause you got
The sharpest edges I've ever seen
Don't hurt me
Hurt me
Hurt me
Usually I just isolate myself
And try not think about
What I'm missing
They promised you would be
The pleasure for all of this pain
But you brought more of it
And now I think I want more of it
Oh yeah I'm sure of it
Are those ten knives or your fingertips?
The berry is sweeter on your darker side
And each time we do it
You're closer to mine
You're broken in places
That don't see the light

Don't hurt me
Hurt me (Ooh)
Hurt me
And I keep checking myself
To make sure I'm still breathing
'Cause the cuts go so deep down
I've lost the feeling

It's my fault that I fall for the
Pain
Ooh you got the sharpest edges

Running free set the world on fire
Scream it loud in the dead of night
Like a wolf I'm howling for you
Take you down to your backroad
It's still the only place I know
Where I can make your world
Melt away for awhile
Something 'bout this country air
Your hand in mine and the wind in my hair
It's the only place I feel like home

813,I Found You,Cash Cash(캐쉬 캐쉬),"On the way I was crowned a king
Felt the wind underneath my wings
I've been high and I've been low
Played the fool and the star of the show
Gone along for a wild ride
And I can say looking in your eyes
That it all would've been a waste
But I found you on the way
I found cynicism I found criticism
I've been the zero the hero
And I have been the villain
I lost more than a heart can take
But I found you on the way
I found you I found you
I found you I found you
It all would've been a waste
But I found you on the way
But I found you on the way
On the way I was given the keys
To the city they were mine to keep
Over time every lock'll change
But you love me all the same
I found pessimism I found skepticism
I've been the corner performer
And sung in front of millions
I lost more than a heart can take
But I found you on the way
I found you I found you
I found you I found you
It all would've been a waste
But I found you on the way

All the broken hearts
Strung over your shoulder
Till it's all in vain
And only you know
The strength of your teeth
The wash in the weight of
Your pockets so deep

In the palm of your hands
You can make me dance
Spin me around in circles
Till I'm wrapped in string
You keep on talking sweet
Till your fingers bleed
But don't you dare ask me
How I've been
Now only you know
The strength of your teeth
The wash in the weight of
Your pockets so deep

Like it's nothing and the words are easy
You talk about me and talk about you
And everything I do

I don't need an alibi or for you to realize
The things we left unsaid
Are only taking space up in our heads
Make it my fault win the game
Point the finger place the blame
It does me up and down
It doesn't matter now
Cause I don't care if I ever talk to you again
This is not about emotion
I don't need a reason not to care what you say
Or what happened in the end
This is my interpretation
And it don't don't make sense
The first two weeks turn into ten
I hold my breath and wonder when it'll happen
Does it really matter?
If half of what you said is true
And half of what I didn't do could be different
Would it make it better?
If we forget the things we know
Would we have somewhere to go?
The only way is down I can see that now
Cause I don't care if I ever talk to you again
This is not about emotion
I don't need a reason not to care what you say
Or what happened in the end
This is my interpretation
And it don't don't make sense
It's really not such a sacrifice
If I ever talk to you again
This is not about emotion
I don't need a reason not to care what you say

This love is like fire and ice
This love is like rain and blue skies
This love is like sun on the rise
This love got me rolling the dice
Don't let me lose
Still falling for you
Still falling for you

Beautiful mind
Your heart got a story with mine
Your heart got me hurting at times
Your heart gave me new kind of highs
Your heart got me feeling so fine
So what to do
Still falling for you
Still falling for you

It took us a while
With every breath a new day
With love on the line
We've had our share of mistakes
But all your flaws and scars are mine
Still falling for you
Still falling for you

And just like that
All I breathe
All I feel
You are all for me
I'm in
And just like that
All I breathe
All I feel
You are all for me
No one can lift me, catch me the way that you do
I'm still falling for you

Brighter than gold
This love shining brighter than gold
This love is like letters in bold
This love is like out of control
This love is never growing old
You make it new
Still falling for you
Still falling for you

It took us a while
Because we were young and unsure
With love on the line
What if we both would need more
But all your flaws and scars are mine
Still falling for you
Still falling for you
Still falling for you

And just like that
All I breathe
All I feel
You are all for me
I'm in
And just like that
All I breathe
All I feel
You are all for me
No one can lift me, catch me the way that you do
I'm still falling for you

Falling, crash into my arms
Love you like this
Like a first kiss
Never let go
Falling, crash into my arms
Never breaking what we got
Still falling for you
Still falling for

And just like that
All I breathe
All I feel
You are all for me
I'm in
And just like that
All I breathe
All I feel
You are all for me
All for me

And just like that
All I feel is you
All I feel is you
You are all for me

They don't understand

I'm all 'bout my business
And ready to save the world

Can't be everyone's favorite girl

The fire burning in my eyes
No nobody but me can keep me safe
And I'm on my way
Lo siento mucho pero me voy
Porque a tu lado me di cuenta que nada soy
Y me canse de luchar y de guerrear en vano
De estar en la linea de fuego
Y de meter la mano
Acepto mis errores tambien soy humano
Y tu no ves que lo hago porque te amo
Pero ya no tengo mas na' que hacer aqui
Me voy llego la hora de partir
De mi propio camino seguir lejos de ti

And then there's nights like tonight that I,
I want you to myself

And tonight I wanna drive so far 
we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights 
And I love the way you look in a firefly glow
Saying everything without making a sound, 
A cricket choir in the background, 
underneath a harvest moon
Standing on your shoes in my bare feet, 
Dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat
Oh woah, and we're 
dancing to the rhythm of your heartbeat

I wanna feel it like a kick drum, 
beating faster in your chest
I wanna feel you holding onto me 
and make me hold my breath
You pull me closer, my head on your shoulder, 
Baby we won't beat the song
We'll make a fallen star wish, one more slow kiss, 
What are we waiting on?

And tonight I wanna drive so far 
we'll only find static on the radio
And we can't see those city lights

I hung up the phone tonight 
Something happened for the first time 
Deep inside.. 
It was a rush, what a rush 
Cause the possibility that you would ever feel 
the same way about me 
It's just too much, just too much 

Why do I keep running from the truth 
All I ever think about is you 
You got me hypnotized, so mesmerized 
And I just got to know.. 

[Chorus] 
Do you ever think when your all alone 
All that we can be, where this thing can go 
Am I crazy or falling in love 
Is it real or just another crush 
Do you catch a breath when I look at you 
Are you holding back, like the way I do 
Cuz I try and try to walk away, 
But I know this crush ain't goin away, goin away 

Has it ever cross your mind 
When we're hangin spending time girl 
Are we just friends 
Is there more, is there more 
See it's a chance we've gotta take 
Cause I believe that we can make this into something that will last, 
Last forever, forever 

[Chorus] 

Why do I keep running from the truth 
All I ever think about is you 
You got me hypnotized, so mesmerized 
And I just got to know.. 

Do you ever think when your all alone 
All that we can be, where this can go 
Am I crazy or falling in love

I'm not going to come down
Down off of these clouds
All these heroes come and go
But you're still standing
You teach me to rise up
To open my eyes up
All these heroes come and go
But you're still standing

You're still standing

You know the world's confusing
I don't care
I crawl into your atmosphere
I know you'll make it right
You're all I need to know

Down off of these clouds
All these heroes come and go

To open my eyes up
All these heroes come and go
But you're still sanding

And you'll never let me fall

Title: Life After You

Lyrics to Life After You :
Ten miles from town and I just broke down
Spittin' out smoke on the side of the road
I'm out here alone just tryin' to get home
To tell you I was wrong but you already know
Believe me I won't stop at nothin'
To see you so I've started runnin'

All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
As long as I'm laughing with you
I'm thinkin' that all that still matters is love ever after
After the life we've been through
'Cause I know there's no life after you

Last time we talked, the night that I walked
Burns like an iron in the back of my mind
I must've been high to say you and I
Weren't meant to be and just wasting my time
Oh, why did I ever doubt you?
You know I would die here without you

All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
As long as I'm laughing with you
I'm thinkin' that all that still matters is love ever after
After the life we've been through
'Cause I know there's no life after you

You and I, right or wrong, there's no other one
After this time I spent alone
It's hard to believe that a man with sight could be so blind
Thinkin' 'bout the better times, must've been outta my mind
So I'm runnin' back to tell you

All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
Without you God knows what I'd do

All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
As long as I'm laughing with you
I'm thinkin' that all that still matters is love ever after
After the life we've been through
'Cause I know there's no life after you"

To fight and never walk away

Here I am still holding on

With every step, you climb another mountain
Every breath, it's harder to believe
You'll make it through the pain weather the hurricanes
To get to that one thing
Just when you think the road is going nowhere
Just when you almost gave up on your dreams
They take you by the hand and show you that you can
There are no boundaries

I fought to the limit, to stand on the edge
What if today is as good as it gets?
Don't know where the future's heading
But nothing's gonna bring me down
I've jumped every bridge and I've run every line
I risked being safe but I always knew why
I always knew why

So here I am still holding on

With every step, you climb another mountain
Every breath, it's harder to believe
You'll make it through the pain weather the hurricanes
To get to that one thing
Just when you think the road is going nowhere
Just when you almost gave up on your dreams
They take you by the hand and show you that you can

You can go higher, you can go deeper
There are no boundaries above and beneath you
Break every rule 'cause there's nothing between you
And your dreams

With every step, you climb another mountain
Every breath, it's harder to believe

Yeah, there are no boundaries
There are no boundaries

With every step, you climb another mountain
Every breath, it's harder to believe
You'll make it through the pain weather the hurricanes
There are no boundaries
There are no boundaries
There are no boundaries"
881,Start Again,One OK Rock(원오크락),"This is where I draw the line
Seen this war a million times
Looking for a peace of mind
Now you hate what we've become
Say the word let's be done
There is something in the way
I'm not always perfect
But I'm always myself
If you don't think I'm worth it
Find someone else
I won't say I'm sorry
For being who I am
Is the end a chance to start again?
Hard to say what's all wrong
Was it this all along
I'm so close you're so gone
We can fake the way we are
I can change
It's my heart
There's nothing left to say
I'm not always perfect
But I'm always myself
If you don't think I'm worth it
Find someone else
I won't say I'm sorry
For being who I am
Is the end a chance to start again?
I know I know I know it's not easy
You can leave here anytime
You know you know
You know it's just not right?
I'm not always perfect
But I'm always myself

A new day...

I was waiting for so long
For a miracle to come
Everyone told me to be strong
Hold on and don't shed a tear

Through the darkness and good times
I knew I'd make it through
And the world thought I had it all
But I was waiting for you

Hush, now

I see a light in the sky
Oh, it's almost blinding me
I can't believe
I've been touched by an angel with love

Let the rain come down and wash away my tears
Let it fill my soul and drown my fears
Let it shatter the walls for a new, new sun

A new day has... come

Where it was dark now there's light
Where there was pain now there's joy
Where there was weakness, I found my strength
All in the eyes of a boy

Hush, now

I see a light in the sky
Oh, it's almost blinding me
I can't believe
I've been touched by an angel with love

Let the rain come down and wash away my tears
Let it fill my soul and drown my fears
Let it shatter the walls for a new, new sun

A new day has... 

Let the rain come down and wash away my tears
Let it fill my soul and drown my fears
Let it shatter the walls for a new, new sun

A new day has... come
Ohhh, a light
Hush, now

I see a light in your eyes
All in the eyes of the boy

I never would have thought
I try to comprehend it
But I knew it from the start
You work a little differently
Than anyone I've ever known
Hope this little moment
Got me chasing you for miles
I open up the window
Just to see if you're around
I'm wishing I could show you all
These feelings that I felt oh oh
You've got a hold of me
I'm diving in head first
Hoping I could love you so recklessly
It hit me like a tidal wave I'm falling off
You got me hypnotized mesmerized
Wrapped around your finger
Till the lights go low
You've got a hold of me
A hold of me
Feeding off adrenaline
That's speeding through my heart
You walk a little closer
And I feel it coming on
I'm crazy for your
Energy that echoes anywhere I go
Riding these highs sunk in these lows
Still on my mind it's out of control
I can't let you go I got
My cards folded waiting for you babe
You've got a hold of me
I'm diving in head first
Hoping I could love you so recklessly

들린다면  내 손을 잡아줄래
So Right So Right

모르겠지만 달랐어넌
I wander around inside your mind
알겠지 넌 달콤한 네 미소가 서툴지만 
그것도 난 그 무엇 보다 내겐
(ah ah ah ah) 

Scent of your perfume
그대의 향기를 곁에서 맡고싶어
전화를 해도 넌 (Oooh)
오늘도 내게 준 답은 없었지만 (Ahhh)
내 미소는 Abloom
I can’t believe it Why am I consumed
I  believe  그래
그래 네곁에서 너만 그저 바라볼래"
896,"Dance, Baby!",Boy Pablo,"I'm sitting alone
Nobody to hold
The people in here are crazy
Faking a smile now
Been here for a while now
I'm fed up with this
I just wanna go home
But damn that girl
Set me up with her
Dance with me baby
Dance with me baby let's get lost right here
Dance with me baby
Dance with me babe under the chandelier
Dance with me baby
Dance with me baby
Don't turn me down for him
What does he have
That I can't give to you girl?
I can't understand this
This guy's just a douchebag
I'm so disappointed in myself
The look on her face says
I hope we go places
I'm left alone
Should've stayed at home
And searched how to date on chrome
Dance with me baby
Dance with me baby let's get lost right here
Dance with me baby
Dance with me babe under the chandelier
Dance with me baby
Dance with me baby
Don't turn me down for him
What does he have
That I can't give to you girl

I could give the world to you
If you turned him down for me"
898,Ain't Giving Up,Craig David(크레이그 데이빗)CONNECT 아티스트,"When you're sober laugh
Sometimes you gotta take a chance 
to break through
And when the world is not enough
That's what gives you everything or breaks you

Feeling empty feeling used
It's like we're running off fumes
A little broken confused
But one thing I know for sure

Ain't giving up on you ain't giving up on you
Ain't giving up on you ain't giving up on you
Ain't giving up on you

Oh oh oh ain't giving up on you
Oh oh oh ain't giving up on you
Oh oh oh ain't giving up on you
Ain't giving up on you

Oh oh oh ain't giving up on you

When the going gets tough
Just remember it's me and you for life
And when the world is not enough
Baby are we worth the fight

Feeling empty feeling used
It's like we're running off fumes
A little broken confused
But one thing I know for sure

Ain't giving up on you ain't giving up on you
Ain't giving up on you ain't giving up on you

901,Enough,Albert Posis,"We need less talk more listening
This back and forth is crippling
How you gonna understand when a
Situation's getting out of hand (Come on)
Level up the communicating
Letting go 'cause it's complicated
Don't wanna lose the patience 'cause
We ain't seeing eye to eye
Drop your feelings off outside
'Cause you know that I can't read your mind
So if you've had enough
Quit wasting all of your time
Ain't gonna leave 'til you're satisfied
Yeah you know we could do better
Tell me have you had enough
Of forever
Are you willing to surrender
Bet you don't even remember
What we're fighting for
('Cause baby)
If you take your love away from me
We'd be losing everything
So say the words you mean
We ain't seeing eye to eye
Drop your feelings off outside
'Cause you know that
I can't read your mind
So if you've had enough
Quit wasting all of your time
Ain't gonna leave 'til you're satisfied
Yeah you know we could do better
Tell me have you had enough
Waiting chasing faking
The problems we created
Retracing it's only
A phase that we're both facing
Faded breaking
She's not satiated say it
It's hard to admit that we ain't
We ain't seeing eye to eye
Drop your feelings off outside
'Cause you know that I can't read your mind
So if you've had enough
Quit wasting all of your time
Ain't gonna leave 'til you're satisfied
Yeah you know we could do better
Tell me have you had enough"

I thought I'd never make it out

I told her again that I'm doing okay
And I meant it

After sex and your moan

Be be be belly in bed
The finest work of a body to ever walked my
Apartment
You're a hum in my ear

With a fear of rushing I did nothing
You got down and picked up your shoes
Any words would do
To make us come through
No excuses

Knowing I could never save you
You were young
But you were never careless
I once knew a woman like you
Harbouring a life an heirloom
Flew to high
Now it will never come back
I was told it lives in us now
In my brother in me somehow
When we woke
Where we are awake
Something's growing
I can't tell you
How can I tell you?
If I don't know what it is
Emptiness finds you
I can't fill it
How can I fill it?
If I have nothing to give
Someone's waiting
I can't show you
How can I show you? I

Swore my walls were fortified
Still you slipped right past
My guard outta sight
Like an old school film
In black & White
I see a love with you thats kinda nice
Could we stay until the morning light?
Or would I come away
With a greyscale heart
I waited by my phone
Hoping that you would call me back
I never thought I'd be
Living in a world where you'd be mine
Like an old school film
In black & White
I see a love with you thats kinda nice
Could we stay until the morning light?
Or would I come away
With a greyscale heart
Would you take me by the hand
And just take this for a spin?
We'll find a way to feel again
Let's just stay a little longer
'Til the credits roll in
My heart on the line for you
Would you take me by the hand
And just take this for a spin?
We'll find a way to feel again
Let's just stay a little longer
'Til the credits roll in

They all laughed at Fulton and his steamboat
Hershey and his chocolate bar
Ford and his Lizzie, he kept the laughers busy

Tu ne voudras pas plus de mon amour

Même si tu penses que je suis gros

Pourquoi tu ne m'aimes plus

Je voulais être libre comme quand j'étais petite
Comment je peux aimer une brute égoïste

Même si tu étais encore plus maigre
Avec les cheveux plein la tête
Je pense que je ne t'aime plus

Oh laisse moi t'embrasser encore une fois
Souviens-toi quand nous marchions au bois

J'ai pensé que tu es belle
Et je sais que tu es celle
Qui restera toujours avec moi

Oh comme tu es tellement persistant
Tu seras le loup et moi le mouton bêlant

Blowing out my mind

From tonight I know that you're the only one
I've been confused and in the dark
Now I understand

I wonder why it is
I don't argue like this
With anyone but you
I wonder why it is
I wont let my guard down
For anyone but you
We do it all the time

Just like an angel off the page

Feel like I'll never be the same
Just like a song in my heart
Just like oil on my hands"

You've finished the climb
You'll find the love you've been running
From was there all the all timeC1
So why you keep on running round

Oh you keep on running round
Stretching over your loose threads
And who can blame you

But you're broken up into pieces
You're trying to find
You could take your problems toss 'em out
In a big ole' heap
But no one is gonna come
And take them off of your side street
Living better is the only way how
Why leave for tomorrow
What you could get done right now?
So why you keep on running round
While your heart melts in your hand
Oh you keep on running round
Stretching over your loose threads
And who can blame you
When it feels so good to be lifted up so high
But you're broken up into pieces
You're trying to find
No it don't take much time to get older
When you try and put the world
On your shoulders
You just need somebody
Who can help you get along
Find some closure
For you to get over
Your troubled mind
Full circle
Love comes around
When the tide of life has worn

And baby
When I close my eyes I'm thinkin' about
If we never met
I'd be drunk
Waking up in someone else's bed
I'd be lost in
A crowded room of fake friends
I wouldn't even know what love is
If we never met"
986,One Last Time,Summer Salt,"Baby girl when was it that you had decided
Oh you'd call it off and on
You were just having fun
With loving one last time
Still I'd catch you when the days
Through at my side passing by
Wishin' someday you'd make up your mind
Oh alone alone again on valentine
Oh alone alone again on valentine
Honey bee was it your buzzin' I adored?
You've stung me twice before
I kept coming back
Kept coming back for more
Always reminded of the days
When you were my
Cherry lime (My cherry lime)
Finding our own worlds getting lost
You and I (Long gone an)
Old friend of mine a blue moons on the rise
No one I'd rather have beside me tonight
Oh alone alone again on valentine
Oh oh oh alone alone again on valentine"
987,Too Good,Christian Kuria,"Girl you're a river
Of healing
I was certain that I wouldn't last
And you are the answer
To questions
That I didn't know my soul was asking
My time's been wasted
Searching for light
When you're the brightest thing in my life
'Cause you're the water that runs forever
When I'm feeling like my well is running dry
And you're my center you keep me tethered
Even when I drift away from time to time
Got me feeling like it's too good to be mine
Too good to be mine
I have been broken
And beaten
Yeah the world knows how to break you down
But when pain blurs my vision
I won't worry
Because you always turn it back around
My time's been wasted
Searching for light
When you're the brightest thing in my life
'Cause you're the water that runs forever
When I'm feeling like my well is running dry
And you're my center you keep me tethered
Even when I drift away from time to time
Got me feeling like it's too good to be mine
Too good to be mine
'Cause you're the water that runs forever
When I'm feeling like my well is running dry
And you're my center you keep me tethered
Even when I drift away from time to time
Got me feeling like it's too good to be mine
Too good to be mine
Got me feeling like it's too good to be mine
Too good to be mine
Got me feeling like it's too good to be
Too good to be mine"
988,Lay And Be Lonely,Shy Girls,"Lay and be lonely lay and be lonely
Lay and be lone
Lay and be lonely lay and be lonely
Lay and be lonely
Am I a fighter or am I just patient?
I know I'm a fool either way
But if there is something
I could be longing for
It would be tranquility
When I'm quiet there is a motion
Shadow's the right
But I'm no songbird
At least not on most days
Most days I sing alone
Lay and be lonely lay and be lonely
Lay and be lonely
Lay and be lonely lay and be lonely
Lay and be lone
Lay and be lonely lay and be lonely
Lay and be lone
Lay and be lonely lay and be lonely
Lay and be lone"
989,Good Day,Surfaces,"Spent all of our time outside all day
Doin' whatever we like our way
Didn't need a wall to build a new space
Every moment just came together like
Two feet hangin' in the water
A few trees stood a little taller
New breeze feels so good
Can't help but remind me
That it was a good day
Not much to do but just lay around
Yeah it was a good day
I'm so glad the sun stayed around
Yeah it was a good day
Not much to do but just lay around
Yeah it was a good day
I'm so glad the sun stayed around
No more school no more rules
No more room to feel these blues
You and views all afternoon
Look at all the time we don't have to give up
Everything we're given is enough
Moments fit together like a glove
All my questions answered by this love
It was a good day
Not much to do but just lay around
Yeah it was a good day
I'm so glad the sun stayed around
Yeah it was a good day
Not much to do but just lay around
Yeah it was a good day
I'm so glad the sun stayed around"
990,Don't Swerve,Annie DiRusso,"You drive me home
You don't swerve but you're stoned
And I sit there quiet
Wonderin' why my love for
You's unrequited
I'm lost 'cause I found
The very thought of you
It follows me around
But don't speak not a sound
If I stay in the dark
The light can't bring me down
Ah ooh
Ah ooh oh ah
Ooh woah
Ah ooh oh ah
Ooh woah
You drive me home
We pretend we don't know
And I sit there smilin'
'Cause I know you know exactly
What I'm hiding
I'm lost 'cause I found
The very thought of you
It follows me around
But don't speak not a sound
If I stay in the dark
The light can't bring me down
Ah ooh
Ah ooh oh ah
Ooh woah

And I know that I'm cool on my own
But I still hope that you'll see
That I am fun and free
And everything you need
When you drive me home
I'm always last and we're always alone
And I sit there tired
Wonderin' when the fuck
This game will expire"
993,More (feat. Sammy Johnson),Jesse Barrera(제시 바레라),"If I could be as honest

Please don't hate me
Cause I'm searching for more
Hey
There's never a right time to say

You know I loved you once upon a time
Don't want to hurt you but I might
Be throwing these feelings away

That your heart just ain't feeling the same
I didn't mean to waste your time
It's been a crazy rollercoaster ride
I don't have the right words to say yeah
Please don't look at me that way
Like you're gonna walk away
Like you ain't got something
Else to say right now
Now girl I know I led you on
And I'll admit that I was wrong
But I think that you should know
That you deserve someone better than me
And I just need to be free
Oh you give me love like I never had before
Please don't hate me

(Come get close to you)

Tell me why I be coming round again

Baby I won't slow down

Pulling me by the string

998,I Wish I Never Met You,Oh Wonder(오 원더),"What a way to wake up
Feeling like I'm overexposed
I guess it’s kind of messed up
That I just wanna keep myself closed

Nothing hurts like being blindsided by love
Nothing hurts like thinking I'm not good enough

I wish I never met you
But it's a little too late
I wish I never met you
But it’s a little too late
You left me with these issues that I just can't seem to shake
I wish I never met you, oh
But it's a little too late
Yeah, it's a little too late
It's a little too late

When I was a young one
Never saw a cloud in the sky
But now I'm coming undone
Staring at myself, wondering why

Nothing hurts like being blindsided by love
Nothing hurts like thinking I'm not good enough

I wish I never met you
But it's a little too late
I wish I never met you, oh

Fist fight with the mirror

It takes time to get bigger
Shine bright, find a rhythm
And I’ll try not be bitter

You were with your friends partyin'
When the alcohol kicked in
Said you wanted me dead
So you show up at my home all alone
With a shovel and a rose
Do you think I'm a joke?
'Cause people like you always want back
What they can't have
But I'm past that and you know that
So you should turn back to your rat pack
Tell 'em I'm trash
Tell all of your friends
That I'm crazy and drive you mad
That I'm such a stalker
A watcher a psychopath
And tell 'em you hate me and dated me
Just for laughs
So why do you call me and tell me
You want me back?

Wrecked your car
Called me cryin' in the dark
Now you're breakin' my heart
So I show up at your place right away
Wipe the tears off of your face
While you beg me to stay
Well people like you always want back
What they can't have
But I'm past that and you know that
So you should turn back to your rat pack
Tell 'em I'm trash

And the sound of your laugh
When I said something funny
But nobody heard it
Except for you
And my mom still asks bout you
I lie and say we're friendly
Cause I don't have it in me
To tell the truth
You and me
What are we if we're not together
We could be nothing
Cause nothing last forever
If you saw me on the train
Would you look the other way
Like strangers do
And if you passed me on the street
Would you look down at your feet
And move on through
Like strangers do
I miss the way that
You looked in your sundress
The way that you looked
When you undressed
The sound of your footsteps across the room
Now my friends don't ask about you
Cause they think I'm fine without you
I say it's all good but it's never true
You and me
What are we if we're not together
We could be nothing
Cause nothing last forever
If you saw me on the train
Would you look the other way

Roundabouts and ups and downs
Yea we've all been on a journey
But we're here right now
It's too late for conversation
My mind is on vacation
I've been counting seconds
To the weekend (Weekend)
Cheap wine in public places
Good friends and bad locations
Tell me what do you want
So tonight lets get high
Pass that joint and kill that vibe
We might laugh we might cry
Middle fingers to the sky

If I've had nights like this
I don't even know how many girls
I've kissed

But the boys down in the valley
Always stay the same
Another line to pass the time
We've been singing here for hours now
It's closing time
Now lets wake up and make that money
Laugh hard when shit ain't funny
Gotta miss the days when we were younger
You feel the way I'm feeling
Glasses up to the ceiling
We're gonna be alright
So tonight lets get high
Pass that joint and kill that vibe

I'd be drunk
Waking up in someone else's bed
I'd be lost in
A crowded room of fake friends
I wouldn't even know what love is
If we never met
What if I never started singing?
What if you never
Told your family you were leaving?
When you felt the pressure
There's a million different reasons
We shouldn't be together
But when I put it all together
It all comes back to you you you

You and the moon

Called me back when I asked you?

I see a little house on the hill
And children's names
I see quiet nights
Poured over ice and tanqueray
But everything is shattering

Drop top down the block
Taking our time doing
Whatever we want
You put your hand on top of my hand
And just like Grease
We were summer loving
Had our first kiss and we hit the
Ground running ah
You put your hand on top of my hand
No dark side for us
No fights just because
No silence that kills ah
No no sleepless nights
Oh just you and I
I love how love feels
So can we stay in this dream like
We are 17
Making love and getting high
You and me
Where we never get angry
Or bitter or lonely
Can we stay in this dream like
We are 17
Where we keep goin' nonstop
Down the block
Sneaking our way into
Every single club
And I have one too many I think
And this thing we have
We didn't know what was it
We didn't know we could get
Messed up from it
And all we really wanted was
Ah ha babe
No sleepless nights
Oh just you and I
I miss how that feels
So can we stay in this dream like
We are 17
Making love and getting high
You and me
Where we never get angry
Or bitter or lonely
Can we stay in this dream like
We are 17
Pin you down kiss me now
We can go in for another round
Pin you down come kiss me now
Pin you down kiss me now
We can go in for another round
Pin you down come kiss me now
I had a dream that we danced
At a crosswalk down the block
Didn't even care that
We made the traffic stop
You put your hand on top of my hand
So can we stay in this dream like
We are 17 (Can we stay)
Making love and getting high
You and me (Can we baby)
Where we never get angry
Or bitter or lonely
(Where we never get oh)

Bet you wonder if I think of you now
Done my best to stay away
But I think I'm going crazy
You and I
You don't wanna talk about it
You don't wanna talk about
You and I
We don't ever talk about it
But in my head
Oh you say say you still want it
That you're done with being lonely now
It's you and I
You and I
Standing beneath the flickered lights
When I shut my eyes you seem closer
Dancing to keep the tears away
Get this heavy weight off my shoulder
And every stranger
I pretend they are you
They'll never hold me
Never touch me like you do
Done my best to stay away
But I think I'm going crazy

Somewhere in the night

You passed me by
See the sun come up now
As it hits my eyes

That you don't wanna talk about

Who is it who they used to be
Someone who isn't me

Said we needed space
We just got closer
Late night missing the little things
Something as simple as baby come over
But I can't forget the way you taste
So I pour another shot
And I pretend that it's your lips
Chase you down another round
Until I taste your whiskey kiss
When you're up at 2 am
You know that I'll be up in five
Let me be your tomorrow tonight
Let me be your tomorrow tonight
I'm feeling foolish thinking 'bout
All the nights that you go out
And the reason I can't do the same
I'm scared I'll call someone your name
Who's bad idea was this trying
To fix something that wasn't broken?
Late at night missing the the little things
Something as simple as baby come hold me
But I can't forget the way you taste
So I pour another shot
And I pretend that it's your lips
Chase you down another round
Until I taste your whiskey kiss
When you're up at 2 am
You know that I'll be up in five
Let me be your tomorrow tonight
Let me be your tomorrow tonight
Let me be your tomorrow tonight
Your tomorrow your tomorrow
Let me be your tomorrow tonight
So I pour another shot
And I pretend that it's your lips
Chase you down another round
Until I taste your whiskey kiss
When you're up and you can't sleep
Because you're still thinking of me
Let me be your tomorrow tonight
So I pour another shot
And I pretend that it's your lips
Chase you down another round
Until I taste your whiskey kiss

비가 오고 난 후 날이 개어있어
어제 골라 놓은 옷을 Dress up

잘 몰라 메이커 난
지금 서둘러 너를 데리러
좋아한다며 노란 해질녘
되어주고 싶어 멋진 연인

지난 주 같이 둘이서
본 드라마 속 주인공
처럼 뜨겁고 불이 올라
타오르는 그런 Love
보여주고 싶어 But
가진 게 난 없고
남자답지 않아
아주 가끔 너도
멋진 Real man 때론 원할 텐데

I'll just be a nerd for you too
이런 널 보며 행복할 나를 알잖아
If you can't stop being you
I'll just be a nerd for you too
It's not nerdy boy
It's you just sweet babe
(Can you love me love me
Love me love me baby)
그냥 너라서 나는 행복해
그래 너도 비교될 거 알아
친구의 남자친구
덩치도 좋아 등에도 업히고
그런 사진에 좋아요 누른 널 보며
나는 또 내 어깰 못 피고
사람 많은 지하철 안에서
너를 끌어안은 적도
머리 하얘질 정도로 키스하는 법도
I don't really know baby
I've been feeling like a huge nerd lately
이런 내 멋없는 모습에
너는 왜 그렇게 날 보며
웃는지 환하게
I wish I really could change for the better
어쩌면 너의 매일은 한심한 나를 향한 배려
가진 게 난 없고
남자답지 않아

I'm a nice guy
I hate being a nice guy
이해 못해
대체 왜일까?
잠을 설쳐
요즘 매일 밤
I've been losing sleep for you
My feelings are free for you
하지 않길 바랄 뿐 후회만
우린 특별하거든 You and I
Can't stop being so damn nerdy
Tell me why am I so damn nerdy"

이뤄질 거라 믿으면

내게 말을 건 것 같아서
한참 동안 길에 서서
잠 못 드는 밤

이런 나의 맘을 아는지
설레이는 나를 아는지
이름 모를 사람들도 
빛이 나는 걸

전엔 만남을 쉽게 여겼지
아무것도 모르고
그런 사랑이 있고 나서야
이제는 알겠어

누군가를 만나는 일
원한다고 쉽게 오지
않을 마법 같은 일 
너무 쉽게 알아버리기엔 
많이 아쉬운걸
이뤄질 거라 믿으면
