3,Bloom,Aidan Bissett,"All of the roads led me to you
Stars on the ceiling in my living room
You're in a white dress bumming a cigarette
That memory's blue
All of these moments laying in ruins
So beautifully broken
Tear out the pages nothing is wasted
And I wouldn't change it
You make everything bloom bloom
Burn my black and white world
Down to the ground
You make everything bloom
We were falling in love that's so naive
My name on your necklace
And your heart on my sleeve
Riding the carousel caring 'bout nothing else
That memory's green
All of these moments laying in ruins
So beautifully broken
Tear out the pages nothing is wasted
And I wouldn't change it
You make everything bloom bloom
Burn my black and white world
Down to the ground
You make everything bloom
(Bloom bloom bloom bloom)
When we were still bleeding
And words ＿
You give me a reason
The sweetest remainder the fuse to my fire
You're all I desire
You make everything bloom bloom
Burn my black and white world
Down to the ground
You make everything bloom
(Bloom bloom)
Burn my black and white world
Down to the ground
You make everything bloom"

13,late nights and lonely,Suriel Hess,"Drive too fast on the freeway
Singing love songs alone in my car
Windows down for the feeling
Just to end up at home in the dark
All alone, treat myself like I can't break
So far gone
Just to see how much that I can take
But when I'm with you, I see in your face
The ways that you love me won't go to waste
The late nights and lonely, I'll trade them away
For someone who knows all the ways that I'll change
You're gentle to me, so I should be the same
I know that you love me, even I'm not okay
Staring up at the ceiling
Funny, you always know what to ask when I
Don't even know what I'm feeling (what I'm feeling)
I get turned around, I don't know how to act when I'm-

14,Love You 'Til I Die,August Royals,"I take my sunshine every morning
Doc says I shouldn’t drink on it
This day to day shits kinda boring
But you’re the reason why, I try, if i’m honest

Will you hate me if I don’t stay long

It’s painful beautiful knowing i’ve got you
Til I die
And I’m not sober for the 27th time
I didn’t mean to relapse but if it’s the last line
Just know when I step into the light I loved you til I died

You write my name with hearts around it
You leave things better than you found it
I always watch things break around me
What hits hardest is darkness has no boundaries

Will you hate me if I don’t stay long

It’s painful beautiful knowing i’ve got you
Til I die
And I’m not sober for the 27th time
Didn’t mean to relapse but if it’s the last line
Just know when I step into the light I loved you til I died"
16,seasons,wave to earth,"I can't be your love
Look it's too trivial for you now
Oh my life's fallin apart
Maybe no one will know if I disappear
But I'll pray for you all the time
If I could be by your side
I'll give you all my life my seasons
I can't be your love
Cause I'm afraid I'll ruin your life
While the leaves withered away
And grew again you have gone far away
I'll be pushing up daisies
And bring all the chances to here
But I'll pray for you all the time
If I could be by your side
I'll give you all my life my seasons
By your side I'll be your seasons

또 주룩주룩 비가 내려와
아마 내가 너를 생각할 때마다
신께서 같이 울어주나 봐
우릴 비추는 달빛마저도 구름에 가려진 이때
내 생각 하면 걷혀질 거야
또 비가 내려 왜 봄비가 내려
내일도 네 생각에 취해서 아마 멍 때릴듯해
포장마차 옆자리에 앉아있던 너
널 보자마자 내 두 눈이 흔들렸던 거야
아마 이건 사랑인듯해
너와 나의 눈이 서로 마주쳤을 때
흠칫하는 너의 모습에 무언가에
홀린 듯이 네 앞으로 다가갔어
어딜 가던 너와 손잡고
예쁜 꽃이 많은 길거리를 거닐 땐
흔들리는 샹들리에 위에서 구름을 걷는듯해
아무것도 안 해도 다 좋았었지 그땐
술을 좋아하는 너와 같이 다니고
이젠 그때 그 자리에서 널 기다리고
다가오는 여자들을 다 지나치던
그 때로 다시 돌아갈 수는 없을까

한 걸음걸음 발을 내디디며 땅을 Step up
잡혀주면 안 될까 잡을게 널 딱 세 번

서울 그 카페 말이야 네가 좋아했던
리코타치즈향과 이젠 작별했어
PARIS BAGUETTE도 이젠 지나쳐도 안 보고
더 빠른 반댓길로 망설이지 않고 틀어 몸
똑같은 거리에서 노력하는 중이야
또 다른 거리들로 변하겠지만
너의 Romance에 내 이름을 써 줘
만약 그게 안 된다면 Extra라도 할게
별다른 생각 없이 나를 부른다면
네가 어느 곳에 있던 지금 당장 달려갈게
기다릴게 오늘까지만
365일 항상 하는 거짓말
오늘도 내 코가 길어졌지만 또 말해
진짜 오늘이 나에겐 마지막
소주 병뚜껑으로 별표 모양을 만들고
너 없는 자리에 괜스레 올려두고 싶은 놈
이제 이 자리는 잊혀지지 않아

Don't know what's come over me
It seems like yesterday when I said
we'll be friends forever
Constellations of stars
Murals on city walls
I don't see nobody but you
You're my vice you're my muse
You're a nineteenth floor view
I don't see nobody but you
Boy you got me hooked onto something
Who could say that they saw us coming?
Tell me do you feel the love?
Spend a summer or a lifetime with me
Let me take you to the place of your dreams
Tell me do you feel the love?

57,no control,anaiis,"The pace of someone's heart
A race in which you cannot start
But I'm still wondering why
I still tend to internalize
When I see the city from above the clouds
Freed from my burden
And I can hear the sound of
An angel now
Suspend me in the air
Lose myself just enough to float
Give upon my powers
And I promise to seek no control
I try my best not to give in (Ooooh)
But try not to chase the feeling (Ooooh)
I'll find my equilibrium (Ooooh)
In the air
Just a tiny fragment of it all
I'm torn between the lines
Shackled when is you and I
And if I have you closer
Is my freedom compromised?
And it seems my bones
Can either float or sink
I feel so heavy when I overthink
The lesson keeps repeating
Suspend me in the air
Lose myself just enough to float
Give upon my powers
And I promise to seek no control
I try my best not to give in (Ooooh)
But try not to chase the feeling (Ooooh)
I'll find my equilibrium (Ooooh)

I think they're seeing through my disguise 
They know 
They know where I've been

From leaving the door open too wide 

Where I've been 
I get told I'm just a stranger

64,TOO MUCH,The Kid LAROI,"If we had the chance and the time to spend
Would you do it again, would you do it again
Was it too much
Was it too much

Now you're calling your friends cuz I'm gone again
When I'm back around would you do it again
Was it too much
Was it too much

So tell me what got in the way
And how I thought it was good that it changed 
And I'm saying I'm sorry again
Oh I could never get out of my way

Hit the store and your wardrobes replaced
And still all that you do is complain
You keep on throwing it back in my face
And now you're telling me I need some space

So i'm laying in my bed
tripped off the shrooms now
I'll be dead before I'm without you now
Realizing I'm addicted to you now
Come here baby relax and cool down

What you saying hit me back with the move now

Am I doing too much
Do you understand my slang and get my sense of humor
When your girlfriends tell you I've been freaking around 
would you believe me if I told you they were lying and that's just a rumor

Send you my personal driver, man this ain't just an Uber
You know it's serious when you stay at mans, ya bring a toothbrush
Extra panties in your bag and some makeup remover
You know I'm hardly on my own cause I stay with a shooter
She call me daddy, she's got issues, I am not her father
Hop off the boat into the jet, leave you at the harbor
She injecting with Ozempic try to stop her hunger
Uh I wanked before you came, so I can love you longer
S650 chauffeur driven, just tap your address in
Pack your bag and we can board the next flight we can check-in
Make sure you check you fill up your anti-depressants
Before I fly you out again and you make me regret it

It's that time pour it up and take one into the head
Top down, almost crashed cuz I'm lookin at your texts

Back and forth and u mad, about shit I never said
Double text, no reply but I know that you read it

What you sayin
hit me back with the move now
In my brain no one else it's just you now
Let me love you the way that I do now
I never knew how

If you had the chance and the time to spend
Would you do it again

I′d treat ya the best way that I can

I said if I was your loverboy
Nothing would hurt ya anymore
I said if I were to be your man
I'd treat ya the best way that I can

Oh, what a fool I've been
Falling for you yet again
Must be a dream I′m in
You got me in the palm of your hand

I′ll take a broken bone
If how I feel
Real alone

That's why I′m standing
Right outside your door
Flowers in hand

I said if I was your loverboy
Nothing would hurt ya anymore
I said if I were to be your man
I'd treat ya the best way that I can

Nothing would hurt ya anymore

79,My Favourite Muse,ZUHAIR,"Girl I love you
And everything you do
I don't mind wasting time
If I'm wasting my time with you
Girl I love you
And everything you do
The world keeps passing by
But I don't really mind do you?
Girl I knew you had my heart
Right from the very start
I felt empty every time
We were apart
Know I'm always in the studio
But I just wanted you to know
I can't wait to come home to you
I hope one day I make it big
Not for the fortune or the fame
Not for the bling
Just so I can go out and buy you everything
Buy you a house and diamond ring
'Cause baby you deserve the sun and moon
You're the reason I smile girl
Every morning when I wake
When I look into your eyes now
I don't want to look away
Girl I love you
And everything you do
I don't mind wasting time
If I'm wasting my time with you
Girl I love you
And everything you do
The world keeps passing by
But I don't really mind do you?
Baby you're my favourite muse
I stopped believing in love
But you're the proof
You make me want to write
A million songs a day
But still I would have more to say
There just isn't enough words for you
I promise I'll catch every tear
You ever cry
And hold your hand through all the years
As they go by
Just know I'll always have your back
If you forget just play this track
And know that I'll always belong to you
In the summer you're my breeze girl
In the desert you're my rain
You're my sunrise and my sunset
The best part of my day
Girl I love you
And everything you do
I don't mind wasting time
If I'm wasting my time with you
With you
Even when all the seasons change
And our lives rearrange
Like they do
The one thing that'll stay the same
Is the I way I feel for you
We can go for a drive in my car
Or just stare at the stars
And the moon
Or we could
Spend the day
Tucked away
In my bed
Just as long as I'm here next to you
Girl I love you
And everything you do
I don't mind wasting time
If I'm wasting my time with you
Girl I love you
And everything you do
The world keeps passing by
But I don't mind do you?
Do you?"

Because you're so far away
I swear that the miles in 
between are the reasons why we argue
Staring at your face over FaceTime
But yet it's just not the same
I swear all the tears 
that you cried had already formed an ocean

Over and over again
We hit repeat
We fight then apologize
Make up and then be alright
Yeah yeah
But if you can't relate,
Then how can we be alright?
We gotta compromise
Why this gotta be so complicated?

84,Why Do I Still? (Unplugged) (feat. May Angeles),Nieman,"I'm aware of the consequence
I'm not ready yet to take that chance
Do I fold or go all in
Persuade my heart to think through it again
It sounds cliche but do you see us being
More than friends
Can't help myself but I'm fallin'
No I can't reveal
How I really feel
Cause I'm
Scared of ruining all we've built
Rather play it safe
Than find out you don't feel the same way
I don't know what I'd do if it were real
Trying my best to stop this love
Even then it's against my will
Even after all is said and done
Why do I still
Why do I still
I wish that I could somehow read your mind
I wonder if I run through yours
The way you do in mine
Can't help myself but I'm fallin'
Words aren't easy
When my eyes don't say the same
Wish I could tell you just as easy as
I say your name
Do I fold or go all in all in all in
And I can't reveal
How I really feel
Cause I'm
Scared of ruining all we've built
I'd rather play it safe
Than find out you don't feel the same way
I don't know what I'd do if that were real
Trying my best to stop this love
Even then it's against my will
Even after all is said and done
Why do I still
Why do I
I realize what's at stake but I don't know
How to show you how I really feel
Truly feel baby
Is where we go all set in stone
Is this storyline signed and sealed
Signed and sealed
Maybe
I'll keep on guessing the same question
And that's if I can go on
Without the one I want
Is this all even worth it
I think it is
But I can't reveal
How I really feel
Scared of ruining all we've built
I'd rather play it safe
Than find out you don't feel the same way
I don't know what I'd do if that were real
No I can't reveal
How I really feel
Cause I'm
Scared of ruining all we've built
I'd rather play it safe

I don't know what I'd do if that were real
Trying my best to stop this love

Things ain't been the same for quite a while
Not trying to beef
Cuz drama ain't my style
I'm just trying to say
Love is a like a flower
That needs water everyday
If you haven't noticed
Just a tad bit off
Girl, something just ain't right
Mundane through the day
And strangers in the night
Maybe it's me
Or maybe it's you
All I know is that we got something to do
Let's take some time and act like
We're still dating
We don't need a reason
No special occasion
And focus on us
Just because
Can we just get back to us
Us
Please say that ya noticed, baby
All the things I've done to make sure
You were good (all good)
If I didn't see the hurt
I misunderstood
I'm just trying to say
Love ain't always roses
Sometimes life gets in the way
Trust me, I have noticed, baby
Gotta find that spark
And make up for lost time
Even when my mind was gone
Day was long
You'll always be mine
Maybe it's me
Or maybe it's you
All I know is that to win
It's gonna take two
Let's take some time to act like
We're still dating
We don't need a reason
No special occasion
And focus on us
Just because
Can we just get back to us
Us
It's on us if we're gonna make it
Baby trust
It takes communication
You and me we gotta
Make it through the night
Gotta find our way back to the light
Let's take some time to act like
We're still dating
We don't need a reason
No special occasion
And focus on us
Just because
Can we just get back to us
Can we just get back to us
You and me we gotta get back to us"

Honey shall I bring you flowers
Would it brighten up your day?
Little missy bounds for hours
Well just name a time all day
What does she see in me?
Lock them doors and throw the key
It's really something in the way
And those gray eyes make me pay

We’re like the ebb & flow
I just wanna see us grow
And I feel so aligned with you by my side
It’s our connection with the best of intentions
I just wanna go away with you into
Another space
With your warm embrace
Grounded while we meditate
Where everything’s okay
Because I see everything that you are
Don’t you ever change (Don’t you ever change)

We get it poppin' leave nothin' in the store

I'm under you pullin' your hair (Pullin' your hair)
Getting lost inside my world
You don't know where I've been
Oh no oh no I feel it comin'
And I tried to save a life
With these diamond hands of mine
But they're sharper than a knife I aimed to kill
And I tried to fix a heart with these lips
That left some scars
'I swear I won't do no harm ' shh
I aimed to kill
I aimed to kill I am made to kill
Love the thrill
I aimed to kill I am made to kill
There's a killer on the run
Someone call 911
I aimed to kill
I feel it comin'
My soul cannot be found
I feel it comin'
Don't fuckin' tie me down
I feel it comin'
No I can't stop it now
The devils got my vows (Oh oh oh)
And I tried to save a life
With these diamond hands of mine
But they're sharper than a knife I aimed to kill
And I tried to fix a heart with these lips
That left some scars
'I swear I won't do no harm ' shh
I aimed to kill
I aimed to kill I am made to kill

107,Self Sabotage,Ruelle,"Just about the time I get it right, everything's in line
I get anxious
If it feels too good to be true then it probably is
I love it but I hate it


I built these walls so tall, pretending I am strong
But really I'm just fragile (Fragile)
I wanna keep you close enough but far enough away
For me to handle



Just when I think that the monster's tamed
I hear it whisper, ""You haven't changed""
At the end of the day, there is no one to blame
But me (But me)


Self-sabotagе
Shot of friendly fire on my way down
Self-sabotagе
Guess I'm always gonna be my own worst enemy


There's nothing in the water, I'm just born to make it harder
When it should be easy
If I could break the spell, I'd shake the gates of Hell
I wanna change, believe me


The deeper I go, the farther I run
Don't wanna be who I've become

Self-sabotage
Shot of friendly fire on my way down
Self-sabotage
Guess I'm always gonna be my own worst enemy

Mm, mm, mm, mmhmm mm mm
Mm, mm, mm, mmhmm mm mm
Mm, mm, mm, mmhmm mm mm

I see your name I had on my phone
You're half in revelations
Wish you'd never let me go
And you say that you miss me (I'm sure that you miss me)
Funny how you think you're such a mystery
Say you gotta tell me something face to face

I know I shouldn't do it, but, hell, I'm gonna do it
I see exactly where I shouldn't go, I'm gonna do it
I've been trying out the high road and then I hit it
I got a lotta sins, but you're my favorite

Baby, you're a bad idea but I could do a few more years
I got a little left in here, funny how you reappear
In the nick of time, I guess I didn't bite
Can't say we didn't try, baby, we're a bad idea
Fuck it, let's do it again

You'll pick somewhere that's private
You and I can really speak
Go ahead and tell me something
That you learned in therapy
And it's almost convincing (It's almost convincing)
But I've known to go against my instincts
And I know you're performing
But it's working for me
We can talk about it in the morning

Baby, you're a bad idea but I could do a few more years
I got a little left in here, funny how you reappear
In the nick of time, I guess I didn't bite
Can't say we didn't try, baby, we're a bad idea
Fuck it, let's do it again

Bottom line, we made it out the first time
Still in love and half alive
We didn't die but no guarantees this time
We might
Alright, fuck it, let's do it again

Baby, you're a bad idea but I could do a few more years (Shh)
I got a little left in here, funny how you reappear
In the nick of time, I guess I didn't bite

To face reality oh oh
Even though you might
Get mad at me oh oh
Sometimes it's hard to face reality
Should've been adjusted to my life
Had the opportunity to stay
And wait for the last time
Now you're standin' right in front of me
It hurts me to know that I lied
Tryna protect your feelings
You been in between the lines
Hope your heart has started healing
Sometimes it's hard
To face reality oh oh
Even though you might
Get mad at me oh oh
Sometimes it's hard to face reality
Don't be afraid to stand alone
Don't be afraid to stand
Outside your comfort zone
I know it's hard away from home
And it ain't easy all alone
Relationships over the phone
Talkin' to your significant
Other all night long
Sometimes it's hard to face reality oh oh
Even though you might
Get mad at me oh oh
Sometimes it's hard to face reality
Sometimes it's hard to face reality
Love and death are quite similar
How they come and go like cat burglars
Reality is kinda hard to face
Like actual facts is to flat earthers
Rain's a requirement for flowers to grow
And pain's a requirement
For power to grow
It's a miracle how one could change
From one what was just hours ago
Such is life though it's just a cycle
The bigger picture and the smaller picture
Exactly same it's macro micro
Crack yo' atom and let yo' light glow
One day you could be the king of pop
Then the next one
Just be wacko michael
It's human nature just like he told us
Let's face reality crack the cycle
Know it hurts to see
The truth in your face
Circumstances bring you down
To your knees
Go on and cry an ocean
But don't drown in it
Enough to put your heart at ease
Oh don't lose your self esteem
I apologise for being a man
It's way harder than what it seems
Sometimes it's hard
To face reality oh oh (Reality)
Even though you might
Get mad at me oh oh
(You might get mad at me
But I'll be at your bedside)
Sometimes it's hard to face reality
Sometimes it's hard to face reality"

I''d be a liar if I told you
That I didn´t see it comin''
I''d be more of a liar if I said:
Hey, I didn''t want it to be something.

You deserve much better
For the love that you have shared
I know u won''t believe it
But girl I swear

That I got love for you, 
Big love for you, 
Even when I''m trippin'', 
The fact remains that you
Will always be my baby, my baby

But dig the truth, 
Baby dig the truth
I can''t hide my feelings

Especially when the whole world can see

That my heart
Is in two different places:

I got you in my life
And I wanna do right
But it´s hard to let it go

When my love has two different faces
And I can''t break ties
''cause they both look right.
Someone tell me

What''s a man to do
When he''s loving two.
And he don´t wanna lie
But he can´t tell the truth

What''s a man to do
When he''s loving two.
But he can´t keep his heart
In two different places
(in two different places)

I know you feel it
''Cause you stayed
There is much more to the story

But I''d be a fool to say
I trust that I´m always gonna love her

You know that you don''t wanna hear
How I´m livin'' on the edge, baby
So I just say ""YEAH, BABY""

She ain´t nothing, 
But she is real
But why I take her through it

When I still got love for you, 
Big love for you
Even when I''m trippin'', 
The fact remains that you
Will always be my baby, my baby

But dig the truth, 
Baby dig the truth
I can''t hide my feelings
Especially when the whole world can see

That my heart is in two different places:

I got you in my life
And I wanna do right
But it´s hard to let it go

When my love has two different faces
And I can''t break ties cause they both look right.

What''s a man to do

And he don´t wanna lie
But he can´t tell the truth

What''s a man to do
When he''s loving two.
But he can''t keep his heart
In two different places
(not in two different places)

I wanna tell you it''s over
And that I ain´t thinkin'' of her
I wanna really mean it
And I want you to see it
That I really try to leave her behind
And I´m tryin'' not to make you cry
I wanna tell you
That I ain''t playin'' games
And I´m dedicated
To receive a change but
When I look in the mirror
It´s the same old me

That my heart
Is in two different places:

I got you in my life
And I wanna do right
But it´s hard to let it go

When my love has two different faces
And I can''t break ties

Will you be my ride or die?
Around all these people
Trying to be someone better than you and I
Posing for pictures but nobody listens
To anything that you have to say
Can't we just leave and walk away?
Walk away walk away
Maybe you won't see me get emotional
And sometimes I pretend I'm just above it all
But I want you lying next to me
Yeah I want your body body body too
Yeah body too
And baby
please don't think I run away from you
It's just sometimes I get scared to dive in too
I want you lying next to me
Yeah I want your body body body too
Yeah body too

141,Roses,Peder Elias,"Yeah I'll just leave them here on the table
I found an open letter
Asking if I feel better
I think my mama read it all last night
Now she feels worried 'bout me
Cause I've stayed inside this whole week
Don't work that way deep down
I know she's right
I'm still too good at thinking 'bout you
Can't help myself
I can't forget that night
I went to say goodbye
Go get the last things I left at your house
I held you one last time
But then they caught my eyes
Wrapped in a paper I'd not seen before
Who gave you all the roses? (Ooh)
Who gave you all the roses? (Ooh)
I wish I hadn't noticed (Ooh)
But who gave you all the roses? (Ooh)
I haven't left our bubble
I think I'm seeing double
I must be drunk
Could swear these walls do talk
That night the rain was pouring
And all those lazy mornings
Am I the only one that wants them back?
I'm still too good at thinking 'bout you
Can't help myself
I can't forget that night
I went to say goodbye
Go get the last things I left at your house
I held you one last time
But then they caught my eyes
Wrapped in a paper I'd not seen before
Who gave you all the roses? (Ooh)
Who gave you all the roses? (Ooh)
I wish I hadn't noticed (Ooh)
But who gave you all the roses? (Ooh)
I bought a set of lilies
Moved to another city
Looking for someone I could give them to"
143,Heartbreak Anniversary,Giveon,"Balloons are deflated
Guess they look lifeless like me
We miss you on your side of the bed mmm
Still got your things here
And they stare at me like souvenirs
Don't wanna let you out my head
Just like the day that I met you
The day I thought forever
Said that you love me
But that'll last for never
It's cold outside like
When you walked out my life
Why you walk out my life?
I get like this every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary
'Cause I remember every time
On these days that feel like you and me
Heartbreak anniversary
Do you ever think of me?
I'm buildin' my hopes up
Like presents unopened to this day
I still see the messages you read mmm
I'm foolishly patient
Can't get past the taste of your lips
Don't wanna let you out my head
Just like the day that I met you
The day I thought forever
Said that you love me
But that'll last for never
It's cold outside like
When you walked out my life
Why you walk out my life?
I get like this every time

144,Running After You,Matthew Mole,"Of all the places and all of the spaces 
that I've ever seen
And that I've ever been, it's true
I'd walk through a town
 I could only have dreamed
But the beauty surrounding 
means nothing to me, it's you


Where you are is where I always want to be
Anywhere as long as you are there with me
I will take you to the places I have seen
Take my heart and run along

'Cause I'm running after you
I'm running after you
And I'll do what I can do
I'll do it all for you


We'll come back home
We'll come back home one day
But right now we are called to see a place
Where you and 
I will change the world we know
Anywhere that I'm with you is home


Where you are is where I always want to be
Anywhere as long as you are there with me
I will take you to the places I have seen
Take my heart and run along



'Cause I'm running after you
I'm running after you
And I'll do what I can do
I'll do it all for you


All the things that we will see 
and all the things we'll know
Take my hand and walk with me, 
we'll never be alone

'Cause I'm running after you
I'm running after you
And I'll do what I can do
I'll do it all for you
And I'll do it all for you

145,Home,Peder Elias,"A crowded street
Somewhere away from home
People all around but I'm alone
Knocking up my self and watching
My teardrop in the snow
And I should feel like
Chirstmas but I don't
It's the time of the year to be joyful
Have fun and be hopeful
And magic appeared
And the bad things go away
So I close my eyes and see the fire light
Snow in the sky the stars shining bright
I swear I can hear angel sing
But I can't see to take it in
Until I go back to
What I've always known
I guess it's truly no place like home
Truly no place like home
Santa giving hugs out in the cold
Children singing carols to only love
I do what I can
I got my mama on the phone
But I can't feel chirstmas until
I'm coming home
It's the time of the year to be joyful
Have fun and be hopeful
And magic appeared
And the bad things go away
So I close my eyes
And see the fire light
Snow in the sky
The stars shining bright
I swear I can hear angel sing
But I can't see to take it in
Until I go back to
What I've always known
I guess it's truly no place like home
Truly no place like home
I guess it's truly no place like home
Truly no place like home"
146,GHOST TOWN,Benson Boone,"You fill me up till you're empty
I took too much and you let me
We've been down all these roads before
And what we found don't live there anymore
It's dark
It's cold
If my hand is not the one
You're meant to hold
Maybe you'd be happier with someone else
Maybe loving me's the reason
You can't love yourself
Before I turn your heart into a ghost town
Show me everything we built
So I can tear it all down
Down
Down down down
You know I'll stay don't you tempt me
But all this weight is getting heavy
Been holding up what wasn't meant to stand
I turned this love into a wasteland
It's dark
It's cold
If my hand is not the one you're meant to hold
Maybe you'd be happier with someone else
Maybe loving me's the reason
You can't love yourself
Before I turn your heart into a ghost town
Show me everything
We built so I can tear it all down
Down
Down down down tear it all down
Down
Down down down
The streets are empty
Where love once was but it's faded away
These broken memories
I'm left here alone and afraid to say
Maybe you'd be happier with someone else
Ooooh
Maybe you'd be happier with someone else
Maybe loving me's the reason
You can't love yourself
Before I turn your heart into a ghost town
Show me everything
We built so I can tear it all down
Down
Down down down tear it all down
Down
Down down down
I'll tear it all down
I'll tear it all down"
147,That's Us,Anson Seabra,"I shoulda known it wouldn't happen 'cause it wasn't right
I shoulda known it 'cause it happens every God damn time
Almost thought we could've been something
Almost thought we could have tried, but
It didn't happen so I need you to get out my life
But the other night I had you in my head
Called you on the phone
Want you stealing my time even though I said I wanna be alone
Oh and I should know this could never work
Oh, this could never end well
Know it's only human but I never learn
I want you for myself
I can take the fall, the pain, the pleasure
And you can take it all, for worse, or better
But oh, what if we're wrong?
What if we're not all that we thought?
Then we won't make it along
But hey, I guess that's us
We couldn't help it but you know that doesn't make it right
You say I'm selfish but I know you felt the same inside
Everybody says it's all okay
Everybody says we're fine, but
Guess someone else is what you need to make you feel alright
But tomorrow night I'll probably call a cab
Show up at your door
Love you in the night time, leave you in your bed
Cold and wanting more
Oh and I should know this could never work
Oh, this could never end well
Know it's only human, but I never learn, I need you for myself
I can take the fall, the pain, the pleasure
And you can take it all, for worse, or better
But oh, what if we're wrong?
What if we're not all that we thought?
Then we won't make it along

148,If the World Was Ending (feat. Julia Michaels),JP Saxe,"I was distracted
And in traffic
I didn't feel it
When the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin'
Were you out drinkin'
Were you in the living room
Chillin' watchin' television
It's been a year now
Think I've figured out how
How to let you go
And let communication die out
I know you know we know
You weren't down for forever and it's fine
I know you know we know
We weren't meant for each other and it's fine
But if the world was ending
You'd come over right
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it
All our fears would be irrelevant
If the world was ending
You'd come over right
The sky'd be falling and I'd hold you tight
And there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye
If the world was ending
You'd come over right
Right?
If the world was ending
You'd come over right
Right?
I tried to imagine
Your reaction
It didn't scare me
When the earthquake happened
But it really got me thinkin'
That night we went drinkin'
Stumbled in the house
And didn't make it past the kitchen
Ah it's been a year now
Think I've figured out how
How to think about you without it
Rippin' my heart out
I know you know we know
You weren't down for forever and it's fine
I know you know we know
We weren't meant for each other and it's fine
But if the world was ending
You'd come over right

You'd come over you'd come over
You'd come over right

149,golden hour,JVKE,"It was just two lovers
Sittin' in the car listening to Blonde
Fallin' for each other
Pink and orange skies feelin' super childish
No Donald Glover
Missed call from my mother
Like Where you at tonight?
Got no alibi
I was all alone with the love of my life
She's got glitter for skin
My radiant beam in the night
I don't need no light to see you
Shine
It's your golden hour (Oh oh oh)
You slow down time
In your golden hour (Oh oh oh)
We were just two lovers
Feet up on the dash drivin' nowhere fast
Burnin' through the summer
Radio on blast make the moment last
She got solar power
Minutes feel like hours
She knew she was the baddest
Can you even imagine fallin' like I did?
For the love of my life
She's got glow on her face
A glorious look in her eyes
My angel of light
I was all alone with the love of my life
She's got glitter for skin
My radiant beam in the night
I don't need no light to see you
Shine
It's your golden hour (Oh oh oh)
You slow down time
In your golden hour (Oh oh oh)"

On the way you used to smile at me
I used to write them for you daily
But my thumbs are running dry lately
No one wants to hear a song
About the bitch that broke my heart
I should have listened to my mama
She saw through you from the start

But now we're here in Regent's Park
Amongst the flowers and I wish it would rain
'Cause in the sun, you look so lovely
That I'm falling for you over again
Since I have nothing left to say
That will make you change your mind
I'll say goodbye on a beautiful spring day

It was a place not too dissimilar to this one
Where I first saw your face
You look like home, sat all alone
I should have found somebody cheaper to chase
Tragically, nobody told me
How expensive you would be
I lost more than money, dear
You knocked the swagger out of me

But now we're here in Regent's Park
Amongst the flowers and I wish it would rain
'Cause in the sun, you look so lovely
That I'm falling for you over again
Since I have nothing left to say
That will make you change your mind

Come and ride with me tonight
Please don't you go
I'll be alone
Wait until the morning
I'll hold you close
Please don't you go
I'll be alone
Wait until the morning
Ride until it's dawning

I know I'm the lucky one
Wonder what I've done to deserve you

152,Wake Me Up,Ed Sheeran(에드 시런),"I should ink my skin with your name
And take my passport out again
And just replace it
See I could do without a tan
On my left hand,
Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle
And I should run you a hot bath
Fill it up with bubbles

'Cause maybe you're loveable
Maybe you're my snowflake
And your eyes turn from green to gray
And in the winter I'll hold you in a cold place
And you should never cut your hair
'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder

And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up

And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me
Could you make me a cup of tea
To open my eyes in the right way
And I know you love Shrek
Because we've watched it 12 times
And maybe we're hoping for a fairytale too
And if your DVD breaks today
You should've got a VCR
Because I've never owned a blue ray, true say

I know I've always been shit at computer games
Because your brother always beats me
And if I lost, I go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV
And then you laugh at me
And be asking me
If I'ma be home next week
And then you lie with me till I fall asleep
And flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets

And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up

And I think you hate the smell of smoke
You always try to get me to stop
But you drink as much as me
And I get drunk a lot
So I take you to the beach
And walk along the sand
And I'll make you a heart pendant
With a pebble held in my hand
And I'll carve it like this necklace
So the heart falls where your chest is
Now a piece of me is a piece of the beach
And it falls just where it needs to be
And rests peacefully
So you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now
Against yours now
Maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Maybe I fell in love when you woke me up"

Acting so tough
Didn't know you had it in you to be hurt at all
You waited too long

Before I put my raincoat on

OK I get it
OK can I see
You were fronting because 
You knew you'd find yourself vulnerable around me
OK I get it
OK I see
You feel vulnerable around me

Hey baby
What's going on?
You lost control and you lost your tongue
You lost me
Deaf in my ear
Nothing you can say is gonna change the way I feel

OK I get it
OK I see
You were fronting because
You knew you find yourself vulnerable around me

OK I get it
OK I see
I step too close to your boundaries

You wanted nobody around to see
You feel vulnerable around me

Hey baby
What is love?
It was just a game
We're both playing and we can't get enough of
We're both playing and we can't get enough of
We're both playing and we can't get enough of"
154,Will you still love me tomorrow,Inger Marie(잉거 마리),"Tonight you're mine, completely
You give your soul so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your sighs
And will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night meets the morning sun

I'd like to know if your love
Is a love I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow
Will you still love me tomorrow"
155,Le ciel dans une chambre,Carla Bruni(카를라 브루니),"Quand tu es près de moi,
Cette chambre n'a plus de parois,
Mais des arbres oui, des arbres infinis,
Et quand tu es tellement près de moi,
C'est comme si ce plafond-là,
Il n'existait plus, je vois le ciel penché sur nous 
qui restons ainsi,
Abandonnés tout comme si,
Il n'y avait plus rien, 
non plus rien d'autre au monde,
J'entends l'harmonica mais on dirait un orgue,
Qui chante pour toi et pour moi,
Là-haut dans le ciel infini,
Et pour toi, et pour moi

Quando sei qui con me
Questa stanza non ha piu pareti
Ma alberi, alberi infiniti
E quando tu sei vicino a me
Questo soffitto, viola, no
Non esiste più, e vedo il cielo sopra a noi
Che restiamo quì, abbandonati come se
Non ci fosse più niente più niente al mondo,
Suona l'armonica, mi sembra un organo
Che canta per te e per me
Su nell'immensità del cielo
E per te e per me
mmmhhhhhhhh
Et pour toi, et pour moi
mmmhhhhhhhh"
156,"Sitting, Waiting, Wishing",Jack Johnson(잭 존슨),"I was sitting, waiting, wishing 
You believed in superstitions
Then maybe you would see the signs 
But lord knows that this world is cruel 
And I ain’t the lord no I’m just a fool 
Learning loving somebody 
Don’t make them love you 
Must I always be waiting, waiting on you? 
Must I always be playing, playing your fool? 

I sang your songs I danced your dance 
I gave your friends all a chance 
But putting up with them 
Wasn’t worth never having you 
Maybe you’ve been through this before 
But it’s my first time so please ignore 
The next few lines because they’re directed at you 
I can’t always be waiting, waiting on you 
I can’t always be playing, playing your fool 

I keep playing your part 
But it’s not my scene 
Want this plot to twist 
I’ve had enough mystery 
You keep building it up 
But then you’re shooting me down 
But I’m already down 
Just wait a minute 
Just sitting, waiting 
Just wait a minute 
Just sitting, waiting 

Well if I was in your position 
I’d put down all my ammunition 
I’d wonder why it had taken me so long 
But lord knows that I’m not you 
And if I was I wouldn’t be so cruel 
Because waiting on love 
Ain’t so easy to do 
Must I always be waiting, waiting on you? 
Must I always be playing, playing your fool?"
157,Summer Is for Falling in Love,Sarah Kang,"We could drive along
An ocean reflecting the sun
Or make a bed of
Green atop a wide open scene
Under a canvas of blue
I would draw ever nearer to you
To feel the dew on your skin
That is how it would begin
For summer is for falling in love
(Mmm)
We could stay out
Late until the sunset's past eight
And the cotton candy haze
Mirrors the warmth of your gaze
Raise your glass to mine and as we drink
We would lock eyes
So we could disregard
The thought of ever having to part
For summer is for falling in love
(Mmm)
(Ba dum)
This lightness of being
We both know to be fleeting
Like the last breath of a sunset
Right before the day is dead
But maybe the heat of today
Could keep even winter away
So I'll remember your laugh
'Cause nothing ever changes the fact
That summer is for
Falling in love (Da dum)
Summer is for falling in love"
158,Movie,Tom MischCONNECT 아티스트,"My cheek brushes against his
Smooth on stubble for a moment
And then it's gone
He walks along the platforms into the dream
Every fiber in me wants to shout and scream
'Stop'
To run across to him take him into my arms
To tell him
'I love you you silly silly man I love you'
But instead I stand still
Heart cracking
These little curls on the back
Of his head bouncing
As he steps out of my life forever
I hope
That the fire we both made
Still burns a little in you
I wrote to you
Everyday did my letters find their way?
Our memories on my screen
Two lovers in this mystic dream
Baby come back to me come back to me
Too much time on my phone
Baby do you still sleep alone?
Come back to me come back to me
Remember me
Fresh out a black and white movie movie
On every screen
What would you realize
What you meant to me was a mystery
Remember me
Fresh out a black and white movie movie
On every screen
What would you realize
What you meant to me was a mystery
I heard
That you moved somewhere far away
Is your number the same as before?
Can't ignore the time
May have changed your ways
Does my record still hang on your wall?
Such a sentimental way to groove
I hope it still touches you
Baby come back to me come back to me
It kills me to see you leave
So I came home and made this beat
Baby come back to me come back to me
Remember me
Fresh out a black and white movie movie
On every screen
What would you realize
What you meant to me was a mystery
Remember me
Fresh out a black and white movie movie
On every screen
What would you realize
What you meant to me was a mystery
Remember me let's set the scene
You and me what could've been
Still swimming in a lover's dream
Still playing on the movie screens
Remember me let's set the scene
You and me what could've been
Still swimming in a lover's dream
Still playing on the movie screens
Remember me let's set the scene
You and me what could've been
Still swimming in a lover's dream
Still playing on the movie screens
Remember me let's set the scene
You and me what could've been
Still swimming in a lover's dream
Still playing on the movie screens"
159,Remember,Sam Ock(샘 옥),"When stars were fallen
When I felt broken
I will remember
You felt the same
When lost in mystery
When lost in wonder
I will remember
You felt the same
When I was lonely
When I was emptied
I will remember
You hurt the same
When I had chosen to love knowing just
What it would cost
I will remember you loved the same
People are broken
But I will love them
And I will remember
You did the same
Through time and distance
Eternity came in the form of a babe
You chose to welcome them into your arms
And I'll do the same
You chose to welcome me into your arms
So I'll do the same"

Movies for two
We'll take off our phones
And we'll turn off our shoes
We'll play Nintendo
Though I always lose
'Cause you'll watch the TV
While I'm watching you
There's not many people
I'd honestly say
I don't mind losing to
But there's nothing
Like doing nothing
With you
Dumb conversations
We lose track of time
Have I told you lately
I'm grateful you're mine?
We'll watch The Notebook
For the seventeenth time
I'll say, it's stupid
Then you'll catch me crying
We're not making out
On a boat in the rain
Or in a house I've painted blue
But there's nothing
Like doing nothing
With you
So shut all the windows
And lock all the doors
We're not looking for no one
Don't need nothing more
You'll bite my lip and
I'll want you more
Until we end up
In a heap on the floor
Mm
You could be dancing on tabletops
Wearing high-heels
Drinking until the world
Spins like a wheel
But tonight your apartment
Had so much appeal
Who needs stars?
We've got a roof (mm)
And there's nothing
Like doing nothing

Mm
No, there's nothing
Like doing nothing

I needed hope
I needed you close
You were by my side
Where were you
Where were you
You were by my side

Any time that I start sinking low
And I think to myself
What would life be if I didn't know ya
You were the spark
That lead the path to carry on
Where were you when
I hurt the most
Where were you when

I needed you close
You were by my side

Where were you
You were by my side

That I would love you 'till the end
You were by my side
You were by my side"
162,You're Gonna Live Forever in Me,John Mayer(존 메이어)CONNECT 아티스트,"A great big bang and dinosaurs
Fiery raining meteors
It all ends unfortunately

But you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, just wait and see

Parts of me were made by you
And planets keep their distance too
The moon's got a grip on the sea

And you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, it's your destiny

Life is full of sweet mistakes
And love's an honest one to make
Time leaves no fruit on the tree

But you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, it's just meant to be

And when the pastor asks the pews
For reasons he can't marry you
I'll keep my word in my seat

But you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, just wait and see"
163,Casual,Jesse Barrera(제시 바레라),"We can take the long way
We'll get there even if
It takes all night
We'll talk until the morning
Don't tell me that
You're fine if you're not fine
And if it's only pleasure that
You're seeking
Then I'll be penciling you in
For the weekend
Forget about the white noise
It's chocolate and pajamas
Till the whole world fades
Just right
Yes please
We can sink into the sofa
For the whole week
Just right

Break down these walls
Over some take out

Savor every moment

When we first met
I find it funny how you hit me
With the silence
Said lady whats the deal
Cuz I'm diggin' your sex appeal
But now when I'm with you I feel
Just right
Yes please
Girl we could kick it at the crib
For like the whole week

Meditation til we let it all go
Lazy days and hazy nights
And new beginnings
If you love me won't you say so

Relaxation til we take it to the limit
Meditation til we let it all go
Lazy days and hazy nights

Of my life
What can I do
What can I say

To stay

I'm a hummingbird
Heavenly ambrosia in every curve
Honey dripping over my imagination

170,23rd Street,Christian Kuria,"Driving down the road at midnight
Gracefully the pieces fall into place
Thinking that we had the answers
To questions that the wisest men can't explain
All I had was you
All I had was you
Wondering just what you're thinking
Every time I step inside golden rays
Do the melodies convince you
Written by a man who's lost and afraid?
All I had was you
All I had was you
All I had was you
All I had was you
Underneath the golden sunlight
California dreams went up in the flame
Everything that came between us
Couldn't cover for the price that I paid
All I had was you
All I had was you
All I had was you
All I had was you"

If I never get up again
I don't want to
Then our song comes on the radio
Makes me wanna start to dance oh
I wanna know
If you feel the same way as me
Why would you go
Dancing I'm all alone
Figuring out how I can get you home
Dancing with my phone
Thinking about you
On my feet and now I'm out the door
Walking by the places that we used to go
I remember all your favorite stores
I won't lie
I don't think I even know myself anymore
You're the one who knew me fucking well
Yeah you know
Dancing I'm all alone
Figuring out how I can get you home
Dancing with my phone

172,Bitter Pill,Christian Kuria,"Would it make you feel better babe
If I told you I've been feeling things
You don't believe in?
Thinking that I'm seeing things
Your heart is in the ground
And my head's through the ceiling
All the possibilities
Losing my ability to know
What you're feeling
I've been wondering what you think about
Baby you don't tell me so I'm only assuming
You don't think I hear you out
But say you're happy long as
I'm giving the time that I'm due and
I could never leave you now
But if you feel like walking out
Baby then do it
Well the rain keeps pouring down
Trouble keeps on coming 'round
(If you tell me you're over it
I'mma tell you I'm over it)
If you're hiding what you feel
Underneath a bitter pill
(If you tell me you're over it
I'mma tell you I'm over it)
I've been searching for the point of it
Moments that we share together
Losing their meaning
Tell me what the matter is
Feeling like you're fighting me
For no fucking reason
Baby take a break from it
Space from all the petty shit should
Give you healing
Well the rain keeps pouring down
Trouble keeps on coming 'round
(If you tell me you're over it
I'mma tell you I'm over it)
If you're hiding what you feel
Underneath a bitter pill
(If you tell me you're over it
I'mma tell you I'm over it)
Baby I'll take it slowly
The truths of your heart unfolding
I want you to rest in knowing
(If you tell me you're over it
I'mma tell you I'm over it)

The truths of your heart unfolding
I want you to rest in knowing

And those brown eyes yes
You're the one that I desire

And we never look back
And whatever I lack you make up
We make a really good team
Though not everyone sees
We got this crazy chemistry
Between us
Jump starting your car
'Cause this city's a bore
Buying e cigarettes at the convenience store
Making new cliches on our own little tour
Let's ride
You don't have to say
I love you to say I love you
Forget all the shooting stars
And all the silver moons
We've been making shades of purple
Out of red and blue
Sickeningly sweet like honey
Don't need money
All I need is you you
All I need is you you you
We try staying up late
But we both are light weights
Yeah we get off our face too easy
And we take jokes way too far
'Cause sometimes living's too hard
We're like two halves of one heart
We are we are we are

All I need is you you you
Eat a pill stay and chill
You don't need to go
I'm about to bring emo back
If you leave my home
I'd panic at the disco
And you'd rather watch a TV show
Then I'll squeeze your booty real hard
Like I'm kneading dough
Pizza boy I'm speeding for ya
We can get married tonight
If you really wanna
Me in a cheap suit like a sleazy lawyer
And if you break this lil' heart
It'd be an honour
You don't have to say
I love you to say I love you
Forget all the shooting stars
And all the silver moons
We've been making shades of purple
Out of red and blue

그 날의 나를
찾을 수 없어

더 어두워진 밤
하루를 짧게 넘기기가
너무 힘들어
널 잃어버린 밤
공책을 꺼낸 다음
움켜쥔 펜으로
꾹꾹 눌러 담은 채
또 새벽이 오면
그런 생각을 해
나는 생각을 해
잠들지 못한 채
또 새벽이 오면
너의 생각을 해
아직도 그 시간 속에서
여전히 그렇게
어느 날
내게 와줬던
그 날의
너를 생각해
어떻게
살아갈 수 있을까
알려줘도 난 못해
또 어느새
우리 기억 속에
하루 종일
난 살고 있는데
널 모르던 그 때로
돌아갈 수 없게
매일 너만 그릴게
또 새벽이 오면
그런 생각을 해
나는 생각을 해
잠들지 못한 채
또 새벽이 오면
너의 생각을 해
아직도 그 시간 속에서
여전히 그렇게
흐릿해진
너의 모습들에
푸른 빛이
스며들 때
언제라도 난
기다리고 있을게
내게로 와줄래

All the clouds are swimming right by
I kind of wonder why
Sometimes I see more through the night
Maybe the stars bright light
Wake up the dark how I liked
But it's different lately
Since the day we said goodbye I
My lover is not mine no longer
But in the sky I still see her face
When all the world on your side
Wakes up in opposite time
Just know that I'm falling apart
Didn't have much of a choice
Promised that I'd still hear your voice
No matter how far you are
In the morning I'd be turning
But I find an empty half of bed
Now I'm hurting and it's worse cuz
I can't get you back
The sky shines brighter 
when we both look my dear
I visualize the stars will guide you here
My lover is not mine no longer
But in the sky I still see her face
When all the world on your side
Wakes up in opposite time
Just know that I'm falling apart
Didn't have much of a choice
Promised that I'd still hear your voice
No matter how far you are
Skys aren't grey as long as you just stay
I'm begging clouds to rain on me
Skys aren't grey as long as you just stay
I'm begging clouds to rain on me
Hope one day I could stare into
The dim blue without picturing me and you
If I whisper that I'm sorry
Would you hear me beyond the stars?
When all the world on your side
Wakes up in opposite time
Just know that I'm falling apart
Didn't have much of a choice
Promised that I'd still hear your voice

These tears can't hold them back
And when I sleep at night
The dreams I have I fantasize of you
Tell me what to do
Thought I might write a song
Hoped you might sing along
Oh girl my head is gone
On Paris nights your mother called I know
Tell me where to go

Breaking more than my heart
Oh
Can we wait?
Till the stars align?
Coz
Stars are made of dreams
Won't you come and follow me?
Baby I can turn around
Maybe you're the one I found girl?
So come lets fall asleep
Back to where we used to be
Oh the night will come to me
Coz the stars are made of dreams girl
Stars are made of dreams
Won't you come and follow me?

Maybe you're the one I found girl?

203,Blu,BENEE,"Mm mm
Don't look pretty when I cry
Do you feel bad when you lie?
You weren't helping me no
You'd make me feel so small
When I lost you
Nothing was good
No longer happy anymore
Had to let it go
Ooh I thought I found the one
But clearly I was blue (Babe)
Blue
Why would I stay?
You forced me away
You were nice 'til you were not
We always fought
Fought a lot
I wonder why you took so long
To realize that the love was gone
Never ever felt so bad
Ooh I thought I found the one
But clearly I was blue (Babe)
Blue

Mm mm mm

You found your way to the sun
The deep end
I'm lost inside of this town
I'm leaving
Oh and I'm on my own
At night when I'm all alone
And someone said
You left your feet on the ground
And I couldn't tell if you'd come back around
And I wonder where you been sleeping now
So I lie in my bed
And you run through my head
'Cause
(Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)
I'm jealous
(Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)
'Cause I'm
(Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah)

Caught my head stuck in the sand
I'm wasting
I look for you when you land
I'm chasing you down
And I'm on my own
In the night when I'm all alone
And someone said you're getting over me
And I couldn't tell if I should believe
And I wonder who you been letting in
So I lie in my bed and I'm lost in my head

208,TODAY,Q(큐),"Ooh some days the pain still stays
Makes you feel helplessness
Time again away from friends
Isolation settles in
Someday we'll be good I pray
But how far away is someday?
Some days I make mistakes
Countless talking about myself
Time again I stay away
Much confusion settles in oh
Some days I fall
But I will press towards the future one day
It gets hard for me to breathe
In a world where I cannot see
What is wrong with me
Lord help me
Some days I make the same mistakes
It gets complicated quickly
When it starts to feel in vain
Then I just go to my vices
That makes me aware
Of everything that makes me numb
And I just hold it in my chest
But will I ever get a time
When I'll be alright to be all by myself?
Oh oh my
Some days I let it be
But I'm underneath my sheets crying out
Out yeah crying
Constant pressure
But I press on for the future some day
Oh constant anger
But I press on for the future one day
Oh oh constant anxious
But I press on for the future one day
And I pray that day will come today"

One to one
We keep up the fight but never get enough
I don't tell you
How it feels
I just walk away assuming time will heal
Baby oh
I just wanna make sense of it all
I can't take the silence when you're gone
I'd fall right back to you
All you'd have to do is just say so
Say so
Picking battles
Keeping score
I tried all the things I never would before
I know well that
Time won't bend
Watch it fade away as anger settles in
Baby oh
I just wanna make sense of it all
I can't take the silence when you're gone
I'd fall right back to you
All you'd have to do is just say so
Say so
I know that I let you down
We could never turn back now
I don't wanna go
Changing on my own
I know that I let you down
You could never love me now
Baby don't you go
Changing on your own

213,It's Been a Little Heavy Lately,Joesef,"Where'd you go?
I just want to look in your eyes
Caught up in your fever dream
The hate between us making me high
Where'd you go?
All I got is you on my mind
I'm coming up easy
Don't care if she sees me
I need you tonight
You know I've been fucked up, crazy
It's been a little heavy lately
But you're the only one who could save me
I know that isn't fair, I know that isn't fair
Why is it my heart is open?
Only when the red light's glowing?
But I'll be yours until the morning
I know that isn't fair, I know that isn't fair
Where'd you go?
I've been looking for you all night
Kissing in the alleyway
Your missus is still dancing inside
Where'd you go?
Can you feel the drip in the lies?
I'm coming up easy
Don't care if she sees me
I need you tonight
You know I've been fucked up, crazy
It's been a little heavy lately
But you're the only one who could save me
I know that isn't fair, I know that isn't fair
Why is it my heart is open?
Only when the red light's glowing?
But I'lI be yours until the morning
I know that isn't fair, I know that isn't fair
Wonder why you're acting surprised
'Cause when you kiss her, you know something's missing
You know that it feels different with me
I guess it must be hard for a guy to look her in the eye
When it's me who's giving you what you need
You know I've been fucked up, crazy
It's been a little heavy lately
But you're the only one who could save me
I know that isn't fair, I know that isn't fair
Why is it my heart is open?
(Why is it my heart is open)
Only when the red light's glowing?
(Only when the red light's glowing?)
But I'II be yours until the morning

I know that isn't fair, I know that isn't fair"

Will she ever

You turn to me

218,Pontiac (Acoustic),Mat Kearney(맷 카니),"I used to worry about nothing
Said I'd never grow up, and
I fell in love and it was enough until it wasn't
I used to dream that we could make it
But now I'm workin' on a paycheck
And the voice on the line says I'm doing fine
Can you tell that I'm faking?


And we watched our friends play the same old game
And we all pretend that we're okay
When we wanna say


Take me back to the time when getting old was turning twenty-five
The single CD that you burned me, you playеd it back
The way we laugh, windows down
Rolling 'round the south sidе of town
On your flip phone, you told your dad, no, you wouldn't crash
Maybe we went too fast
In your Pontiac


My mama worried about my marriage
But now I'm worried about my parents
You could try to run from what runs in your blood
But you still gotta share it



And we watch our friends play the same old game
And we all pretend that we're okay
When we wanna say


Take me back to the time when getting old was turning twenty-five
The single CD that you burned me, we played it back
The way we laugh, windows down
Rolling 'round the south side of town
On your flip phone, you told your dad, no, you wouldn't crash
Maybe we went too fast
In your Pontiac


I used to worry 'bout real life
Until I fell into your eyes
I fell in love and it was enough to make me realize


You take me back to the time when getting old was turning twenty-five
The single CD that you burned me, we played it back
The way we laughed, windows down
Rolling 'round the south side of town
On your flip phone, you told your dad, no, you wouldn't crash

All of this money can't pay my dues
I just want some of your patience
Stay with my body like face tattoos
Maybe I'll send a location
Maybe I'll put all this blame on you
Blame on you
Then it's dark
And the world goes quiet
And you don't feel right
But your friends aren't there
Those empty sounds
Don't let me drown
I've been listening to the same old songs again
I've been wishing
I could change up make amends
I've been living in the corners of my mind
I know I could run but there's nowhere to hide
Weather don't do me no favors
I spent all summer inside my bed
Scribblin' lyrics on pages
I spent all summer inside my head
That's where I'm feeling my safest
That's how I'm filling my time instead
Those empty sounds
Don't let me drown
I've been listening to the same old songs again
I've been wishing
I could change up make amends
I've been living in the corners of my mind
I know I could run but there's nowhere to hide

221,People on Vacation (Feat. Marle Thomson),Anthony Lazaro,"I guess we're probably not ready yet to settle
And It's too early to plan a trip together
And I guess an invitation would be forward anyway
We’ll be two people meeting casually on vacation
Trying to make the most
Of the situation
Somehow you’ll accidentally stay in the bedroom
Next to mine
So we'll bump
Every night and every morning
Into each other
A-ha
We'll relive the surprise
Of being together
Like casual lovers
A-ha
I'll just stop by and
Strike a conversation
I will sit with you and ask for information
And I will tell some stupid jokes
If I feel you're looking blue
We will be wearing strictly
Casual dressing
When we travel our encounters are a blessing
Cause I will always end up
Sitting xext to you
So we'll bump
Every night and every morning
Into each other
A-ha
We'll relive the surprise
Of being together
Like casual lovers
A-ha
So we'll bump
Every night and every morning
Into each other
A-ha
We'll relive the surprise
Of being together
Like casual lovers

We met when we were drunk
And you made fun of me for how I dance
And the shitty old band
Then you were holding my hand
Said baby need a friend
You took me to your place just to fix your
Your broken heart
The next day you were gone
I'm a silly little boy
I haven't got the chance to say I love
That tattoo on your hand
I don't even know your name
But maybe you're everything that I want
You're prolly halfway around the world
But baby oh you're still in my head
I might just be a fool for you
Still hopin' I could see you again
I hate that I still
Think of you
That little tattoo on your hand"

Now you know that I'm not the type

Got a letter from an old friend the other day
Crumpled up, had a scent reminiscent of May
Said she's doing just fine, 
that I've been on her mind and
That she wishes that I never ever went away

I gave it all I had
Just to let it go
But you should know that I tried
I tried
I tried
I tried
Just know that I tried
That I tried
I tried
I tried
Got a call from an old friend the other night
He said that he just saw you and you're living a lie
We were always best friends
It all came to an end and things change
One day I hope you realize

I tried
I tried
I tried
I tried
Girl, I tried
Yeah, I tried
I tried
I tried

Maybe one day
We'll find common ground
When the weather's warm
And the trees are green
Maybe when leaves start falling
Maybe then we'll find ourselves together again

That's it my seeds are there in your garden
I fell in love with smoke and mirrors
The spring I guess we'll see if we blossom
Or are we just fallen petals
Is it autumn

Maybe one day
We'll find common ground
When the ocean's cold
And the pigs all fly
Maybe when the sky starts falling"

Special number one and a couple of sides
I'm checking out this weekend
I'm just not feeling it
I've got the balcony
My piece of the sky
Thought I heard the door
But there's no one outside
I need to get my head checked
'Cause with you gone
There's almost nothing left
Guess I've hit that time of life
When I need some quiet nights
On my own
Man this city's too much for me
Too many cars to count them
Too many days that look the same
Too many nights without you
It's a long way up to the 15th floor
Too many miles behind me
Too many times when nothing's changed
Too many nights without you
It's a long way up to the 15th floor
I've gotta stop buying this shit
Ordered twenty shirts and none of them fit
I need to take a rain check
But then someone calls
And you're back inside my head
Guess I've hit that time of life
Watching TV late at night
On my own
Man it's getting so hard to sleep
Too many cars to count them
Too many days that look the same
Too many nights without you
It's a long way up to the 15th floor
Too many miles behind me
Too many times when nothing's changed
Too many nights without you
It's a long way up to the 15th floor
I need some time some empty space
Somewhere with an ocean view
The simple life the slower pace
Way up on the 15th floor
Too many cars to count them
Too many days that look the same
Too many nights without you
It's a long way up to the 15th floor
Too many miles behind me (Too many times)
Too many times when nothing's changed

Usually the things we say
Aren't what we really mean to say

We spin round in circles

We'd make a different shape

I'll put my best foot forward
I'll trace my steps back
I'll lean a little closer just to take a whiff of that
You seem a bit distracted a little off track
You'll turn the light on
I'll set you right back

You do me, when I'm feelin' moody
We don't say excuse me, when we fight
You seduce me, when I'm feelin' moody
You know how to do it, just right
Just right

Why don't we set up by the side so we
Can see if we were really meant to be
Seems to me
We put on a show but only we know 
what goes on behind the scenes

I'll put my best foot forward
I'll trace my steps back
I'll lean a little closer just to take a whiff of that
You seem a bit distracted a little off track

I forgive the days
You walked away and left me cold
I forgive you

So many things I wanted to share
All of those times it didn't feel fair
But pressure it makes a diamond so rare

Before
Meanwhile everyone else got lost in quiet
By the river
Seeking for more, of course he found better

He saw them, they saw him
But everyone just kept on going
What he saw was different
He should have gone to bed
But instead he stuck around for the mood

In the shadows he saw four eyes, lit by fire
Fire
He’d never done that with a lover before
Before
He was seeking for more
Either early or too late, it was number seven
And it happened
High like a bird with his beak through the window

He saw them, they saw him
But everyone just kept on going
What he saw was different
He should have gone to bed
But instead he stuck around for the mood

He saw them, they saw him
But everyone just kept on going
What he saw was different
He should have gone to bed
But instead he stuck around for the mood

He was seeking for more
He was seeking for more
He was seeking for more
He was seeking for more
He was seeking for more
He was seeking for more
He was seeking for more
He was seeking for more
He was seeking for more
He was seeking for more
He was seeking for more
He was seeking for more"

Yeah, I just wanna tell you nobody
Gives me these vibes and butterflies
So I'll be anything you need
You're already everything I want
Gonna make you, smile
And show you you're the only one
That's on my mind, that's on my line
Fall all over again

Baby, every time, girl, every time you smile
I don't want a day without you around, no

Love at first sighting
It's that thunder and lightning
Got to shut tight my eyelids
Pearly whites, so damn blinding (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Try to find the words to say
But all I got is cosmic violence
High tops, don't wanna walk away
Kissing is imminent and I'm excited

It's impossibly natural
Baby, baby lemme get to know you

(I hope) I'll make you smile for a while, baby
(I hope) You'll find love in my eyes

248,All Things End,Hozier(호지어),"A two-tonne weight around my chest feels like
It just dropped a twenty-storey height
If there was anyone to ever get through this life
With their heart still intact, they didn't do it right
The last time I felt your weight on my chest, you said
""We didn't get it right, but love, we did our best""


And we will again
Moving on in time and taking more from
Everything that ends



And all things end
All that we intend is scrawled in sand
It slips right through our hand
And just knowing
That everything will end
We should not change our plan
Whеn we begin again


And we bеgin again, hmm-mm


I have never known a silence like the one fallen here
Never watch my future darken in a single tear
I know we want this to go easy by being somebody's fault
But we've come long enough to know
This isn't what we want
And that isn't always bad

When people say that something is forever
Either way, it ends


And all things end
All that we intend is scrawled in sand
It slips right through our hand
And just knowing
That everything will end
We should not change our plan
When we begin again


We begin again
We begin again, hm-mm

And all things end
All that we intend is built on sand
It slips right through our hands
And just knowing
That everything will end
Won't change our plans

It slips right through our hand
And just knowing
That everything will end
We should not change our plans

Could wake up to you every day
I never ever plan to be away from you
From this world to the next
Believe me when I say that it's

Hold on tight

And your loneliness is at the front door

Slow dancing around our kitchen

In the shapes in the clouds

Wrinkled silk on my sheets

Sinking down to my past
I wish you'd see me

See me like I'm on TV
Singing my life like Stevie
I'm wondering what could've been
But where's the purpose or meaning?
Already green here

You say that we’re fine

Acting like you’re mine
But it’s a different story

It’s better to lose, mm
Than for you to take it all
I’m feeling used
You know it’s true

You call me over
Just to numb the pain
It’s always the same
You call me over
Hoping that you’ll change
But it’s always the same 

Chorus:
When i’m alone at night
I’m going out of my mind
I can still feel your hands on me

Holding on to a lie
Ignoring all the signs
I can still feel your hands on me 

Verse 2:
I know you like to play
Like all of it is made up 
It’s you that i crave 
My body won’t give you up

Holding my breath, mm
Feeling so desperate
I can’t pretend
I don’t want this to end 

Pre:
You call me over
Just to numb the pain
It’s always the same
You call me over
Hoping that you’ll change
But it’s always the same

Watched you give up on us, 
it broke me to pieces

Heard it all, still not impressed
Your words just bring so much stress

I know you’ve been through it,
I can hear through the walls
is it where you’re numbin’ me for nothin’ at all?

Cause when the night feels long
and you’re still in your head about
when things went wrong
will I still be the only one that’s on your mind?
If I can see it in your eyes

Was it everything that you thought?
Cause love can be so blinding sometimes , my dear
I know cause I’ve been here before

Cause you know that I’ll be there
just to catch you when you fall
I know you’ve been through it,

Cause when the night feels long
and you’re still in your head about
when things went wrong

That nobody had the time for yesterday

You'll never love somebody else this way
And though I'm still battered and bruised
I forgave the world the day that I met you

Mm-mm, mm-mm

The people talk, it's background noise
I don't wanna hear nobody else's voice
There's something sweet about your scent
It's like lavender came and never left

But then you called, only to say
You'll never love somebody else this way
And though I'm still battered and bruised
I forgave the world the day that I met you

Mm-mm, mm-mm
Nothing ever seemed to go right
All my days they just fell into nights
Until I got a little bit of you in my life
And then suddenly everything's bright

I know there's a million different ways I could say
How you're always the part of my day
And when you feel the need to forget the world
You can call anytime you want
Call anytime you want

You need it
The ego's always hungry so you feed it
Keep alive the child's mind
You nurture and believe him

Time on earth is fleetin'
And Since none of us are in control
We outta learn to let it go

I'd put it all in reverse
If only I could I would turn back the clock
To before I ever knew you and then
I'd still end up at that same old restaurant
And fall for you all over again
All over again
You and I were magnetized
Connected by the great divine
Tiny electrons always intertwined
And if I had a hundred million lives
With infinitely different storylines
It would be you every time
If only I could I would turn back the clock
To before I ever knew you and then
I'd still end up at that same old restaurant
And fall for you all over again
All over again and again and again
And I've fallen again
Maybe there's some other universe
I'd still go after you first
If only I could I would turn back the clock
To before I was yours and then

and walk to you (me)

Wish I could get my friends to understand
I wish I was a better singer, or better than I am
I wish one little thing would go to plan
I'm sad, I'm stressed
Maybe that's just life, I guess

Don't wanna sound ungrateful
No, I'm not doing bad
Another day could be the best I've ever had
Oh but today, today I'm feeling sad

I wish I was a morning person, but I'm not
I'd rather sleep some more, and man why not?
I always feel so undeserving, but I deserve a lot
Took some time but now I know I'm not, not just a mess
And maybe that's just life
Maybe that's just life
Maybe that's just life, I guess"
293,let me know,Gareth.T,"Would you let me know
What have you been doing I know
Now I'm not there inside your picture
But I do wanna know
Wanna know
So please let me know
If you need me I'll be alone
I've been spending too much time home
Stoned
'Cause my best friend
She won't pick up the phone
But why would she pick up
She gave you everything and you gave up
Just admit you never really did enough
That you're not good at love
Didn't love her enough hm
And when we talk it's just silence
We still text but there's distance
I don't see her often
The break up wasn't sudden
But now my weekends are boring
And my friends are all clueless
And she's the only one I could call
Would you let me know
What have you been doing I know (I know)
Now I'm not there inside your picture
But I do wanna know
Wanna know
So please let me know
How have you been? Do you go out more
On the weekends?
I'm barely at home
Stoned
'Cause I'm getting used to you being gone
You being gone
You being gone
You being gone
You being gone
Our memories have piled up
It's hard to really give up
Something that I once loved
Never thought it's this tough
I never felt all these feelings
And they all feel so foreign
Like all these strangers I got to know
So please let me know
If it's too much
Then just let me go
Let me ponder inside of your memory
It's cozy
Just pick up me when you feel alone
Don't let me know
How you're doing
'Cause I miss you too
And I'm trying
To let go of you
It's new
There's no we there's only me and there's you"
294,Somebody Good,Stacey Ryan,"You say my sense of humor is dry, is that alright?
Is it just not something you're used to
I spend so much time trying to change, but that was a waste
'Cause I know what I will and I won't do

I wanna say what I mean, and mean what I do
Without being mean and still staying true

'Cause you know I don't litter, I'm a really good tipper
And I won't be late, if you ask me out to dinner
I'm just doing my best to be someone with integrity
Somebody good

Someone that you can trust in, who follows instructions
Who holds the elevator, if they see somebody running
I don't need to win the lottery, isn't it enough to be
Somebody good

This world is crazy most of the time, but hey so am I
I'm just trying my best to get through
I don't wanna dampen your day, rain on your parade
Half of the time I don't know what I'm doing, 'cause I'm only human

Tryna say what I mean, and mean what I do
Without being mean and still staying true

By now you know I don't litter, I'm a really good tipper
And I won't be late, if you ask me out to dinner
I'm just doing my best to be someone with integrity
Somebody good

Someone that you can trust in, who follows instructions
Who holds the elevator, if they see somebody running
I don't need to win the lottery, isn't it enough to be
Somebody good

Who doesn't cut the line, somebody good
(Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Pours you the last glass of wine, somebody good
(Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Who holds the door open, like they should
(Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Who loves you when you're broken
Mmm, somebody good"
296,LET THE GRASS GROW,Ruel(루엘)CONNECT 아티스트,"I wait for the morning tide
The oceans to rise
But I lay here broken
Too heavy to float
I'm an emotionless wreck
So I tell myself this lie
I'm not scared to die
Make molehills of mountains
There's gold in this ground
But I ain't found it yet
So I leave before you go
'cause there's no tears when it's my fault
This self sabotage
All of our other scars
Don't compare
Take the river to the sea
Drown myself so I don't sink
Find my peace there underneath
The hurricane
Break a promise so I can leave
Burn a forest so I can sleep
Lay my headstone
Let the grass grow over me
There's nothing to fill this void
Stuck turning the soil
So I lay here soaking
There's sand in my bed
What a day to regret
So I leave before you go
'cause there's no tears when it's my fault
This self sabotage
All of our other scars
Don't compare
Take the river to the sea
Drown myself so I don't sink
Find my peace there underneath
The hurricane
Break a promise so I can leave
Burn a forest so I can sleep
Lay my headstone
Let the grass grow over me
We didn't make a difference
And we thought we were different"
297,405,Gracie Abrams,"I, I took the 405
I drove 100 miles an hour to forget you
And I blew through the traffic light
If I were to go tonight, I think I would regret you

You took the half of me that I needed
And how'd you walk away so easy?
It's almost like you like to let me down
You took half of me, could you leave it
And go back to when we were speaking?
I hate the fact that I miss you around

Please, you won't even look at me
It's getting embarrassing, I'm crying to my family
And now I'm, I'm harder to recognize 'cause
I cut all my hair last night while you think of me barely

You took the half of me that I needed
And how'd you walk away so easy?
It's almost like you like to let me down
You took the half of me, could you leave it
And go back to when we were speaking?
I hate the fact that I miss you around

Tell me why
How the hell I slipped your mind
You forgot me overnight
Didn't even try to hide it
All the while, lost my head and appetite
You've consumed, like, all my nights
Now I know it's unrequited

'Cause I, I took the 405
I drove 100 miles an hour to forget you

You took the half of me that I needed
And how'd you walk away so easy?
It's almost like you like to let me down, down
You took half of me, could you leave it
And go back to when we were speaking?
I hate the fact that I miss you around"
298,Just Don't Know It Yet,New Hope Club(뉴 호프 클럽),"An ordinary conversation caught me by surprise
You had me with 'hello'
I lost you with 'goodbye'
A million different situations
Running through my mind
I'm still in every memory reliving every line
And I don't know if I'm crazy
But I'm thinkin' maybe
Just maybe
I see a house upon a hill
With our names written on the bell
I see a picture of a family
On the kitchen windowsill
Children running in the garden
Singing 'catch me if you can'
Baby this is the plan
From the moment we met
You just don't know it yet
Yet yet
You just don't know it yet
Yet yet
I met you for a latte at your local coffeeshop
There was so much to be said that
We couldn't find the start
We were sitting there for hours
And we didn't say a lie
But the feelings that
You gave me said the words that we did not
And I don't know if I'm crazy
But I'm thinkin' maybe
Just maybe
I see a house upon a hill
With our names written on the bell
I see a picture of a family
On the kitchen windowsill
Children running in the garden
Singing 'catch me if you can'
Baby this is the plan
From the moment we met
You just don't know it yet
Yet yet
You just don't know it yet
Yet yet
You just don't know it yet"
299,One On The Way,Jake Scott,"Heart stopped when I saw your black dress 
Long hair looked like an actress 
I was leaving I started thinking  
Of questions to ask
I took my shot to get to know you
One more tequila soda 
I said hello 
Made a bad joke 
And you faked a laugh and said 

Are you gonna buy me a drink 

Said I got one on the way
I was reading the signs
Didn't know what you'd say
But I had to try 
I knew I'd regret 
If I let you pass me by
I didn't know your name
But I loved your smile 
Some chances you take 
Change your whole life
So I bought another round
If that's okay 
I got one on the way
I got one on the way 

Six months I had no doubts 
My friends told me to slow down 
But we were falling already all in 
Knew it was meant to last
That summer I made some big plans 
Something to wear on your left hand 
We went to Paris I was talking marriage 
And you just laughed and said 

Are you gonna buy me a ring

Said I got one on the way 
I was reading the signs 
Didn't know what you'd say 
But I spent my last dime 
I knew I'd regret 
If I let you pass me by 
I knew it was fast 
But I knew it was right
Some chances you take 
Change your whole life
Wanna give you all of mine 
If that's okay 
I've got one on the way 
I've got one on the way 

One dive bar 
And one first kiss 
Who knew we'd end up like this
Life is full of turns and twists 
Like finding out
These two kids 

Got one on the way 
And for the first time 
I don't know what to say 
Looking into your eyes 
Guess the greatest things 
will catch you by surprise 
Now we're thinking of names 
We can't decide 
Crazy how one moment
Changes your whole life
And we might be scared to death but that's okay 
We got one on the way
We got one on the way 

We got one on the way"
301,Introverted,James Smith,"Remember when six weeks
Felt like a lifetime?
Swear everyday's faster now
We all know this city
Runs on caffeine and white lines
But I wanna slow it down

The suns getting low in the sky
We've reached that familiar time

But boy, don't be bad, come on
Take a step back from the window
You know you don't have to be high to get by
You're good as you are
Just take a breath
Walk through a field
Tell all the people you love how you feel
Remember, you used to be fun
But suddenly you've become
Introverted

I got a to-do list
That I never finish
And that really grinds me down
I'm pulling out chunks of my hair
And I'm well-aware
That I'm only 23 going on dead
I wanna be happy now

The suns getting low in the sky
We've reached that familiar time

But boy, don't be bad, come on
Take a step back from the window
You know you don't have to be high to get by
You're good as you are
Just take a breath
Walk through a field
Tell all the people you love how you feel
Remember, you used to be fun
But suddenly you've become
Introverted

Well, I left a bit on the side
It's staring me dead in the eye
The suns getting low in the sky
And I'm feeling lonely tonight

But boy, don't be bad, come on
Take a step back from the window
You know you don't have to be high to get by
You're good as you are
Just take a breath
Walk through a field
Tell all the people you love how you feel
Remember, you used to be fun
But suddenly you've become
Introverted"
302,Alonica,LANY(레이니),"I'm fallin' out of love with you, LA
Runnin' out of reasons I should stay
I'm overwhelmed, I'm over it
It's too cold here anyway
I'm fallin' out of love with you, LA


Back to Alonica
Where the sun is out all the time
My favorite beach is there
And the sand, it stretches for miles
Singin' la-di-di-di-da
And slowly dancin' 'til the mornin' comes
I feel most at home when I'm back in Alonica


Darlin', I have finally settled in
The water's perfect for a midnight swim
It's paradise, the stars and I
Are catchin' up like old friends
My heart is learnin' how to love again

Back to Alonica
Wherе the sun is out all the time
My favoritе beach is there
And the sand, it stretches for miles
Singin' la-di-di-di-da
And slowly dancin' 'til the mornin' comes
I feel most at home when I'm back in Alonica


[Bridge]
Made up of a thousand colors
And everything is in its place
I don't know the last time there were
Tears like this upon my face
Every artist falls in wonder
Even Michelangelo
If God is really out there somewhere
This must be His other home

[Chorus]
Back to Alonica
Where the sun is out all the time
My favorite beach is there
And the sand, it stretches for miles
Singin' la-di-di-di-da
And slowly dancin' 'til the mornin' comes
I feel most at home when I'm back in Alonica"
303,Rain,Mina Okabe,"I love when it rains
Perfect excuse to let myself stay in and
Pretend I have it all under control
I don't know what I'm doing
All I do is notice everything I do wrong
Everything I do wrong
I don't want to be the reason I'm feeling stuck
Want someone to blame for being messy as fuck
Say I'm alright know it's not okay to lie
Talk about it
But can't put my thoughts into words
What is up with people making me feel worse?
I say I'm alright know it's not okay to lie
I keep on saying I'm fine
Feel bad when I complain
Wanting to be the optimist I'm seen as
Why do I wait with getting things done
Procrastinate then regret?
All I do is notice everything I do wrong
Everything I do wrong
I don't want to be the reason I'm feeling stuck
Want someone to blame for being messy as fuck
Say I'm alright know it's not okay to lie
Talk about it
But can't put my thoughts into words
What is up with people making me feel worse?
I say I'm alright know it's not okay to lie
Always say I don't need any help
Thinking I can do it all by myself
Always say I don't need any help
Think it's better is it better? Wait for better
Think it's better is it better? Wait for better
I don't want to be the reason I'm feeling stuck
Want someone to blame for being messy as fuck
Say I'm alright
Know it's not okay to lie (Not okay)
Talk about it
But can't put my thoughts into words
What is up with people making me feel worse?
I say I'm alright know it's not okay to lie

I love when it rains
Perfect excuse to let myself stay in"
305,Sad Songs In A Hotel Room,Joshua Bassett,"i’m wearing the robe
the same ones we left on the hotel floor
one year ago
do not disturb hanging on the door
how the hell we end up where we did
don’t you think it’s messed up
it all went to shit
it’s kinda depressing being here alone
i miss you so i pick up the phone
i order room service for one
champagne mini bar bottles are done
i’ve got a balcony room with a view
velvet curtains are closed 
singing sad songs in a hotel room
oh
where i once held you 
i’m singing sad songs in a hotel room
neighbors are knocking they just wanna sleep
it’s 3am while my guitar gently weeps
i flip through these old magazines
dream destinations we promised we see
how the hell we end up where we did
in one year it all went to shit
i order room service for one
champagne mini bar bottles are done
i’ve got a balcony room with a view
velvet curtains are closed 
singing sad songs in a hotel room
oh
where i once held you 
i’m singing sad songs in a hotel room
we checked in together
i never checked out
guess it’s heartbreak hotel
cause just look at us now
i order room service for one
champagne mini bar bottles are done
i’ve got a balcony room with a view
velvet curtains are closed 
singing sad songs in a hotel room
oh
where i once held you 
i’m singing sad songs in a hotel room"
306,Dangerously Easy,Olivia Dean,"Old flame where do you love from?
Explain how did you find your way?
This happiness suits you
A job you don't hate
Painting the town with your mates
And an arm full of bad tattoos
You make it look easy
Dangerously easy you do
Old flame where did she come from?
That face smiling in my place
This happiness suits you
She's probably the one
Gets on so well with your Mum
And all the way down to Earth (Earth)
You make it look easy (Easy)
Dangerously easy (Easy) you do
But I'm still stuck in my own way
Always choosing the hard way
It feels like every time
I try taking it easy
I don't even believe me
And you just burn the same
Old flame where do I get something true?
What have I got to do to make it look easy?
(Easy)
Dangerously easy (Easy)
To make it look easy (Easy)
Dangerously easy (Easy)
Like you?"

With white wine to chase them
Lying on the hills
We kissed until we couldn't breathe
The coldest sand is on the beach
Now she's in her swimsuit
With the yellow stripes
Cutting it with scissors 'til there's nothing left
And rubbing sunscreen on her dress
She's putting on sunglasses
I could win I could lose
But that's a look I can't refuse
I could win I could lose
But that's a look I can't refuse

308,Day After Day,GANGGA,"I walked into the bar
Same place that I would go to every single day
I wanted answers
These empty glasses oh they never know the way

Cause I'm still longing
Now you are too far
Day after day
I'm tryin' my best to live without you
Now I'll be my own star
Day after day
I'm tryin' to find, another you in someone new
(Day after day I)
I am still here without you
(Day after day I)
Life is boring without you

You've left me somewhere far
Some place that I can't find
No matter how I try
I wanted closure
Wish you were closer so you hear the things I say

Cause I'm still longing
Now you are too far
Day after day
I'm tryin' my best to live without you and
Now I'll be my own star
Day after day
I'm tryin' to find, another you in someone new

I am still here without you
(Day after day I)
Life is boring without you
(Day after day I)
I am still here without you
(Day after day I)
Life is boring without you

In the cold late night
Till early morning
I do believe that
Overthinking comes rightly
At those hours
3 or 4 AM, but I'm not sure
Yes, cause I'm not sure"
309,Love You Anymore,Devin Kennedy,"Feels like we've been here before
One too many times
Doing like we always do
We were in heaven
But heaven fell through
I guess love is a catch 22

Swear that we've been here before
It's harder every time
Two people playing pretend
We rewrite the pages
Again and again
But even the best stories end

So I'll make it easy
Yea, I'll take the blame
I'll let you hate me
To help ease the pain
I'm stuck on this feeling
I just can't explain
I used to be sure
But I don't think I love you anymore

I wish that I could hold you close
To fix a broken heart
Cause we know the magic is gone
But you're gonna find it with someone i'm not
And they're gonna love you a lot

And in 20 years I'll think of you
And wonder where you are
I know that you'll think of me too
We'll replay the memories
That only we knew
I'll always be grateful for you

So I'll make it easy
Yea, I'll take the blame
I'll let you hate me
To help ease the pain
I'm stuck on this feeling
I just can't explain
I used to be sure
But I don't think I love you anymore

I used to be sure
But I don't think I love you"

With nothing new to say
But pretty eyes to match the sky
And softness in her face
She can't decide and never cries
I think it's just her style
Margaux stay a little while

Countless hours spent outside
To waste her time away
And over bearing endless staring
Into out of space
I can't recall the time before
I felt so out of place
Margaux left without a trace

Sunday mornings
Are quieter these days
And when do I
Get back the time we wasted
We both know
There's no one else to blame
Margaux left and nothing felt the same

Another meal in silence
And I don't know what to make
My room is still a mess
And my hair is just the same
I contemplate and wait for something
Just to make me move
Margaux said I'd never loose

Sunday mornings
Are quieter these days
And when do I
Get back the time we wasted
We both know
There's no one else to blame
Margaux left and nothing felt
Margaux left it's for the best
Margaux left and everything has changed"

Call me over
Add one more scar
Still I don't mind

What would I be if I walked away

We were meant to be
I'm facing the demons inside of me
You kiss me slow
You tuck me in
I stay home and slip my jacket on again while
You go down by the river
I give you what you're needing
But I'm tired of always bleeding
I watch as you're slipping away
And darling
You know we're meant for each other
I'll take my time
You're one of a kind
Or maybe I'm blind
I'll explain
Now I'll face the truth
If there's hope for you
Then there's hope for me too
We circle round
It's just one more game
Maybe I'll try this just
One more day and
No thats not what I need
I'll start thinking bout me
No one chooses the person I have to be
I'll try to let you go
i'll run away from you
I'll learn how to love
and be loved by somebody new while
You go down by the river
I give you what you're needing
But I'm tired of always bleeding
I watch as you're slipping away

Oh and you
You've been hiding in plain sight
And it appeared oh I know
Loving you once only feels wrong
I need you
I always knew I'd find you
To be here is worth the wait to
I'm not lying

We will leave all behind
And we're seeking the truth
In the darkest of blue
Where there's no need to hide
And the fear you describe
Won't be able to reach
The height that we keep
If we had the power to hold one moment in time
We could stay forever watch the stars and loose our minds
If I had the power to keep you forever mine
I still see the darkest blue every time I close my eyes
If we had the power to hold one moment in time
We could stay forever watch the stars and loose our minds
If I had the power to keep you forever mine
I still see the darkest blue every time I close my eyes
And I reach for the sky
As I look in your eyes
A reflection of me
In the deepest blue sea
Wanna know what you hide
Take the fear you describe
Wanna be all you need
Wanna see all you see
If we had the power to hold one moment in time
We could stay forever watch the stars and loose our minds
If I had the power to keep you forever mine
We are only fractions we need each other to survive
If we had the power to hold one moment in time
We could stay forever watch the stars and loose our minds
If I had the power to keep you forever mine
I still see the darkest blue every time I close my eyes"

Don't know what to do with what I'm handed
Don't know where to go and where I'm landing
if I'm landing
Did you plan this?
Oh it's damaging
I'm unraveling
Hardly managing
Most days battling questions
I don't have answers too
Like what did I what did
I what did I what did I do?
I didn't know that last night was

Never scared of being honest, where's the fun?
I'm lying to you baby, I would rather run
Than let you down because I knew you were the one

You're too good, you see?
You got me rolling on the ground the way you look at me
And I've been trying to take you out just like I do in my dreams

Maybe, girl, let me know

In the drop top we will just get high
In the nighttime we will live our lives
In the nighttime that's when I got by
In the nighttime, in the nighttime

The world might really end
Can we be more than friends?
Can we just not pretend?

But I'm hoping you're right there

She's walking all alone, now

Prayin' things I don't believe

My mind it can be a scary place at times
So I hide under my bed
And close all the blinds
And I cry and I cry
Waste the day away so I turn on the lights
And I search for a sign
Or a rhyme or a reason
Why I'm unsteady as the seasons?
'Cause flowers don't grow without the rain
And goodness don't grow without the pain
Flowers don't grow without the rain
And goodness don't grow without the pain
I've been down on my knees
Prayin' things I don't believe

So I decide to be happy
I've been down on my knees
Prayin' things I don't believe
Hopin' that it'll save me
So I decide to happy
So I decide to be happy
If you're happy and you know it
Clap your hands
If you're sad and you know it
Well now's your chance to dance
If you're happy and you know it
Clap your hands
If you're sad and you know it
Well now's your chance to dance
Well now's your chance to dance
Now's your chance to dance

Kiss the earth that birthed you
Gave you tools just to stay alive

426,Wait To Wake Me Up,Lepani,"Bad start bad day
Hard work no play yeah
Sad faces all around me
And I feel the same
I can feel the pain yeah
Broke car broke phone
Broke bank broke home
Heart broke and I can't believe
That I'm in this again
I'm looking forward to my bed tonight
Turn my pillow to the colder side
I'd do anything to close my eyes
And feel alive til the stars align
When all of my dreams
Wanna go for a walk
And I don't wanna talk about the day
I wanna end
So could you remember
To wait to wake me up again
Just another one of those days
In the worst way
You don't know babe
I've been looking forward to
Being with you tonight
Tell me how your day's been
How your work went
Was it any different?
Cos I've been on a roller coaster ride
Take me out
And tuck me in into your love tonight
Keep you close into the morning light
I'd do anything to hold you tight
And feel alive til the stars align
When all of my dreams
Wanna go for a walk
And I don't wanna talk about the day
I wanna end
So could you remember
To wait
When all of my dreams
Wanna go for a walk
And I don't wanna talk about the day
I wanna end
So could you remember
To wait to wake me up again

See when you smile
Smile in your sleep
Sleep now don't worry
Cos you know that I'll wait
I'll wait to wake you up again"
427,Give Me Your Forever,Zack Tabudlo,"Do you remember
When we were young you were always with your friends
Wanted to grab your hand and run away from them
I knew that it was time to tell you how I feel
So I made a move, I took your hand
My heart was beating loud like I've never felt before
You were smiling at me like you wanted more
I think you're the one I've never seen before

[Chorus]
I want you to know
I love you the most
I'll always bе there right by your side
'Causе baby, you're always in mind
Just give me your forever (Give me your forever)
I want you to know
That you'll be the one
And I'll be the guy who'll be on his knees
To say I love you
And I need you
And say I'd die for you (Just give me your forever)

[Verse 1]
I never knew
It would be possible
For you to be with me
'Cause you loved someone else back in '73
I was so jealous seeing you with him
Oh baby, I know that I can treat you better back in those nights
Oh you wouldn't cry from his stupid lies
Oh baby, I was there watching wishing you to be mine


[Chorus]
I want you to know
I love you the most
I'll always be there right by your side
'Cause baby, you're always in mind
Just give me your forever (Give me your forever)
I want you to know
That you'll be the one
And I'll be the guy who'll be on his knees
To say I love you
And I need you
And say I'd die for you (Just give me your forever)

Do you remember
I was on the aisle
Waiting for you, babe
Saw you in your gown
I was crying all my tears
I told myself that you are the one
(You are the one)

[Chorus]
I want you to know
I love you the most
I'll always be there right by your side
'Cause baby, you're always in mind

And I stole my sister's car
I thought my life was over
But you let me get this far

I hate to think aboutit
But my parents they ain't getting any younger
I can't ignore the truth
That everyday that passes by
It's hard to have to realize they're numbered
As much as I don't want to

I know one day
I'll have to face
You won't be there
But I don't wanna I don't wanna I don't wanna

It's just not fair
Cause I don't wanna I don't wanna I don't wanna
Miss you yet

Cause I don't wanna I don't wanna I don't wanna

The way you'd leave the light on
Stay awake till I get home
Yeah I'm always causing trouble
But you'd always let me know
It's just hard to imagine
A world without you there
Who's gonna leave a light on?
Who will be waiting by the stairs?

I hate to think about it

I'm flying solo inside this spaceship
Wish I could get back the time I wasted
You helped me down when I get too far away
I know that everything will be okay
Maybe these tears will stay in yesterday
I know I've been up down up down lately
Just a couple words from you could save me

Just a kid who always followed the stream
Blaming everybody else for my pain
Now I know that it sounds pretty strange
But hear me out, I didn't feel pretty good
Oh, I got so fed up, I misunderstood
What was really important, what I had to get sorted
How I was meant to grow up

Mistakes that we learned from
The choices that we made
I know that I hurt some
And I'm left to blame

'Cause I've played my games, I've sunk my ship
And there are still some voices whispering
My shadow's staying near, tryna get me down
But I know better, I know better now

I was locked up, shackled in chains
Heavy breathin' bringing smoke to my brain
Everybody tellin' me I'm insane
Now I know that it sounds pretty strange

Mistakes that we learned from
The choices that we made
I know that I hurt some
And I'm left to blame

431,Lifetime,Faime,"I met you in the summer
When you moved here from Ann Arbor
Two kids believed in fate
I would climb up to your bedroom
While your parents tried to catch you
As we danced the night away

And we were just kids
But we knew it was love
Twenty years old
The whole world against us
A hundred more years
Still wouldn't be enough
Forever in love
It began with a crush

Where you go
I'll go too
It's only life if I'm
Living it with you
I'll always be
By your side
I am yours and
You are mine
In every lifetime

We moved into the lake house
The one from your old hometown
Two kids along the way
We raised them to be lovers
With eyes just like their mother's
That light up their whole face

We taught them to love
Even when their heart breaks
They grew up and soon
Each of them moved away
And they could have kids
Of their own someday
No matter the distance
We loved them the same

Where you go
I'll go too
It's only life if I'm
Living it with you
I'll always be
By your side
I am yours and
You are mine
In every lifetime

I'm so happy that I met you
And you spent your life with me too
Two kids believed in fate
Now even though were older
We love like we were younger
For the rest of our days"

All I see is is nothing but all my flaws
Negative thoughts in the shower
Yea I can't seem to to accept who I am
Cause there's so many people out there
Who don't even need to try
To look perfect they way they are
Oh why can't I just be like them and
Have a little confidence in me? oh
I wanna believe
But it ain't easy
I wanna be seen
But it's all blurry (woah)
Tell me how do I get over this
Cause I don't wanna cry no more
I wanna believe
But it ain't easy woah ooo woah
Still looking right up at the mirror
Thinking bout all all the memories made
Beautiful souls all around me (all around me)
Oh I'm trying to accept who I am
Cause there's so many people out there
Who don't even need to try
To look perfect they way they are
Oh why can't I just be like them and

433,Peter Pan Was Right,Anson Seabra,"I guess Peter Pan was right
Growing up's a waste of time
So I think I'll fly away
Set a course for brighter days
Find the second star I'm soaring
Then straight on to the morning
I know that I'll be fine
'Cuz I know Peter Pan was right
Just a lost boy in a small town
I'm the same kid but I'm grown now
Try to make it out
But I don't know how
Wish that I was young
What have I become
Now it's late night and I'm at home
So I make friends with shadow
And I play him all my sad sad songs
And we don't talk
But he sings along like
Oooh
Fairy tales are not the truth
What am I supposed to do
Mmmmmm..
I guess Peter Pan was right
Growing up's a waste of time
So I think I'll fly away
Set a course for brighter days
Find the second star I'm soaring
Then straight on to the morning
I know that I'll be fine
'Cuz I know Peter Pan was right
Days feel like a blur now
Still feel eighteen but I'm burnt out
So I daydream of what I could be
If I turned back time
To a storyline
Where my mom read me a tale where
A couple kids one girl and a sailor
Met a boy in green
I thought it'd be me
But I guess that dream
Wasn't meant to be like
Oooh
Fairy tales are not the truth
What am I supposed to do
Mmmmmm..
I guess Peter Pan was right
Growing up's a waste of time
So I think I'll fly away
Set a course for brighter days
Find the second star I'm soaring
Then straight on to the morning
I know that I'll be fine
'Cuz I know Peter Pan was right
And I don't care
If I never land
Cuz' the distant sky's
Always better than
My life right now
And the place I am
So for one last time
I guess Peter Pan..
I guess Peter Pan was right
Growing up's a waste of time
So I think I'll fly away
Set a course for brighter days
Find the second star I'm soaring

I'm wondering if I can choose
To hold onto something
Or let go when my heart tells me to
Maybe we know how it's all gonna end
Baby we crash and we burn
Over and over and over again
The lesson that I have to learn is
It's not love, but
It's still something
It's enough to keep
Me from running from you
Might know it too
But maybe we're afraid of telling the truth 'cause
It's not love, but
It's still something
But, isn't it nice?
How I come alive
When the moon meets your eyes, it's
Not a surprise that we've held on for so long
But, doesn't it hurt?
To get so high and fall down so slowly
What it worth it worth?
When you give your all and you get back nothing?
Maybe we know how it's all gonna end
Baby we crash and we burn
Over and over and over again
The lesson that I have to learn is
It's not love, but
It's still something

Me from running from you

어색해서 좋은 거였던 인사
불필요했던 우리의 시작
흐를수록 온몸으로
느껴진 해로운 시간

너 때문에 꽃 피는 것도 못 보고
추위에 얼어붙은 내 심장

조금은 늦은 듯 이제야 만났네

넌 사랑을 믿니 이런게 운명인 거니
달달한 말들이 내게 들리네

니 옆에서 니 손을 꼭 잡고
사랑이 넘치는 눈빛으로 바라보다

저절로 나오는 이 노래가
널 닮아 그럴까 아름다운 이 멜로디

왜 웃음이 날까 자꾸만 전화길 볼까
주위에선 내가 좀 변한 것 같대

나 왜 이런거니 자꾸만 니 생각만 나
꿈꾸던 사랑이 너였었나봐

내 앞에 서있는 니가 웃고 
니 옆에서 니 손을 꼭 잡고

중력을 뿌리친 채 저 하늘로

나를 봐. 푸른 달빛 속에서
나를 봐. 흩어져 깨진 거울 속에서
어느새 지금껏 네가 알고 있었던
나는 내가 아니게 돼.

Bad moonrise tonight 또 다른 나를
지금 네게 보여줄 테니.
1, 2, 3 & 4 자, 시작할게.
너만 준비가 됐다면

거친 숨의 열기로 붉게 물든 눈빛
손톱을 세워 밤을 찢어내고
쏟아져 내릴 듯이 낮게 깔린 하늘
어둠을 가르는 내 검은 날개

Come & see tonight 지금의 나를 
너는 결코 잊어선 안 돼.

나의 하얀 옷에 너의 잉크가 묻어
닦아낼 수 없을 만큼 번졌네
달콤한 색감이 물들어 조금씩

내일은 말을 걸어봐야지
요즘 노랜 뭔가 맘에 안 들어
네게 불러 주기엔 좀 어려워서
나름 며칠 밤을 새워 연습했지만
네게 들려주기엔 무리인 것 같아
너는 번질수록 진해져 가고
나의 밤은 좀 더 길고 외롭지만
하루종일 떠오르는 너의 얼굴은
방을 가득 채워 무지개같이
달콤한 색감이 물들어 조금씩
정신을 차렸을 땐 알아볼 수도 없지
가득 찬 마음이 여물다 못해 터지고 있어
내일은 말을 걸어봐야지
바람을 맞고 빗물에 젖어
나의 색감도 흐려지겠지만
너는 항상 빛에 반짝일 테니까
멋진 말들을 전하지 못하고
아무도 관심 없는 그림이 되겠지만

I was barely holding on
To the thought of a moment like this
I bet I was lost
And alone
I was barely holding on
To the thought of a moment like this
I must've been lost
And Alone
I was barely holding on
To the thought that someone like you exist

I'll take your hand tonight
We could just slow down time"
463,Time Machine,Daisy the Great,"Are you listening to the clocks in this house?
They are growling at me
They are growling at me
Saying, how can it be?
That the whole world is falling
Apart

The sky is burning
No more need to hurry
We were right to worry
We were right to worry
The birds are gone now
The time has come now
Just close your eyes now
Just close your eyes now
The sea is crying
The moon is sighing
It's terrifying
It's terrifying
It's all around us
The end has crowned us
The star has found us

I once read about a time machine
They learned to teach electrons
To go back to where they started
Should we go back to where we started?
Baby, we could build a time machine
And put it in my old car
Fill it up with dirty water
We could try a little harder

If I go back? If I go back?
Will I do it all the same again?
If I go back? If I go back?
Will I do it all the same again?
If I go back? If I go back?
Will I do it all the same again?
If I go back? If I go back?
Will I do it all the same again?

464,Don't Go Wasting Time,Alfie Templeman,"Some time alone don’t hurt the heart
Catching feelings from the start
You’re better off leaving it to me
Cause I am happy as far as I can see

Don’t go wasting time on the past
Chasing things that weren’t meant to last

Some lonely days will drag you down
When you know you’re not the best around
And the one you love is nowhere to be seen
So you keep on staring at the TV screen

Don’t go wasting time on the past
Chasing things that weren’t meant to last

When I’m alone 
I never seem to get you off my mind
When you’re on the phone to him,
I’m always behind
When we talk occasionally 
my heart skips a beat
I’m running for you

Don’t go wasting time on the past
Chasing things that weren’t meant to last"
465,I Love You So,The Walters,"I just need someone in my life
to give it structure
To handle all the selfish ways
I'd spend my time without her
You're everything
I want but I can't deal with all your lovers
You're saying I'm the one
but it's your actions that speak louder
Giving me love when you are down
and need another
I've got to get away and let you go
I've got to get over
But I love you so
I love you so
I love you so
I love you so
I'm gonna pack my things
and leave you behind
This feeling's old
and I know that I've made up my mind
I hope you feel what I felt
when you shattered my soul
'Cause you were cruel and I'm a fool
So please let me go
But I love you so (Please let me go)
I love you so (Please let me go)
I love you so (Please let me go)
I love you so"
469,I GUESS I'M IN LOVE,Clinton Kane,"Oh I'm obsessed
 With the way your head is laying on my chest
 How you love the things I hate about myself that no one knows
 But with you I see hope again

 Oh I'm a mess
 When I overthink the little things in my head
 You seem to always help me catch my breath but then I lose it again
 When I look at you, that's the end

 And why do I get so nervous when I look into your eyes?
 Butterflies can't stop me falling for you

 And darling, this is more than anything I've felt before
 You're everything that I want but I didn't think I'd find
 Someone who was worth the wait of all the years of my heartbreak
 But I know now I've found the one I love

 And I love the way
 You can never find the right things to say
 And you can't sit still an hour in a day
 I'm so in love, let's run away
 Because us is enough

 And why do I get so nervous when I look into your eyes?
 And butterflies can't stop me falling for you

 And darling, this is more than anything I've felt before
 You're everything that I want but I didn't think I'd find
 Someone who was worth the wait of all the years of my heartbreak
 But I know now I've found the one

 Come close
 Let me be home for anything
 Good or bad, I know it's worth it, whoa

 And darling, this is more than anything I've felt before
 You're everything that I want but I didn't think I'd find
 Someone who was worth the wait of all the years of my heartbreak

Changes into something red
Her mother doesn’t like that kind of dress
Everything she never had she’s showing off

Driving too fast
Moon is breaking through her hair
She said it was something that she won’t forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

Were only getting older baby
And Ive been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you’ve ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there’s nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you

Chasing it tonight
Doubts are running round her head
He’s waiting, hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beating loud, she doesn’t want it to stop

Moving too fast
Moon is lighting up her skin
She’s falling, doesn’t even know it yet
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

Were only getting older baby
And Ive been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you’ve ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there’s nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you

Going out tonight
Changes into something red
Her mother doesn’t like that kind of dress
Reminds her of a missing piece 
Of innocence she lost

Were only getting older baby
And Ive been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes?
Everything that you’ve ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there’s nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change, baby
It will never change, baby
It will never change me and you"
473,Dark Enough to See the Stars,Weezer(위저),"Why was I ever born
And why did God make me
He must have been high
When he dropped me down here
All of my neighbors
Have shut off their porch lights
Like smoke from their chimneys
I'll soon disappear
It's dark enough to see the stars
I wonder who and where we are
Solitude is all I know
And as the years pass by, it grows
It's dark enough to see the stars
I wonder who and where we are
Solitude is all I know
And as the years pass by, it grows
When it's high noon
I go blind from the light beams
Reflecting off snow
Like a merciless sword
When the night falls
I'm grateful for blackness
That blankets my sadness
It's my lone reward
It's dark enough to see the stars
I wonder who and where we are
Solitude is all I know
And as the years pass by, it grows
It's dark enough to see the stars
I wonder who and where we are
Solitude is all I know
And as the years pass by, it grows
I don't want to die alone
Lord, I'm running out of hope
I don't want to die alone
Lord, I'm running…
It's dark enough to see the stars
I wonder who and where we are
Solitude is all I know
And as the years pass by, it grows
It's dark enough to see the stars
I wonder who and where we are
Solitude is all I know
And as the years pass by, it grows
It's dark enough to see the stars
I wonder who and where we are

474,Memories,Conan Gray,"One two
It's been a couple months
That's just about enough time
For me to stop crying
When I look at all the pictures
Now I kinda smile I haven't felt that in a while
It's late I hear the doorbell ringin' and it's pourin'
I open up that door
See your brown eyes at the entrance
You just wanna talk
And I can't turn away a wet dog
But please don't ruin this for me
Please don't make it harder than it already is
I'm trying to get over this
I wish that you would stay in my memories
But you show up today just to ruin things
I wanna put you in the past
'Cause I'm traumatized
But you're not lettin' me do that 'cause tonight
You're all drunk in my kitchen
Curled in the fetal position
Too busy playing the victim to be listening to me
When I say
'I wish that you would stay in my memories'
In my memories stay in my memories
Now I can't say 'goodbye'
If you stay here the whole night
You see it's hard to find an end to somethin'
That you keep beginning over and over again
I promise that the ending always stays the same
So there's no good reason in make believin'
That we could ever exist again
I can't be your friend can't be your lover
Can't be the reason we hold back each other
From falling in love
With somebody other than me

To be right where you are
How old is your soul?

To do some navigating
I'll be here patiently waiting
To see what you find

Some even fall to the earth
We got a lot to learn
God knows we're worth it
No I won't give up
 
I don't wanna be someone who walks away so easily
I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make
Our differences they do a lot to teach us how to use
The tools and gifts we got yeah, we got a lot at stake
And in the end, you're still my friend at least we did intend
For us to work we didn't break, we didn't burn
We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in
I had to learn what I've got, and what I'm not
And who I am
 
I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love

Like it's taken off the shelf
Giving me these complications (complications)
You turn me into someone else

I don't want nobody else

Gonna need it
Dance in the dark
If you feel it
Just trying to start a conversation with you
Maybe for once get the courage
Known you for months, still make me nervous
What's holding me back? I got nothing to lose

Well I hope you don't look at me as a friend
But I love it when you look at me like that

So can I kiss you yet?
Picture the moment inside my head
Playing it out like a vhs
Over and over again
So can I kiss you yet?
Throw myself to the bottom
And once we start there ain't no stopping
Let's go all night
So can I kiss you over and over?
Again, again, again, again, again, again, again
Over again, over again

Just like I thought, like no other
Hands on your skin melt like butter
Can't get enough and I love the way that you taste
Now that you're my piece of heaven
Still want you bad, more than ever
When I'm alone I'm impatiently waiting

So hurry up, hurry up, come back
'Cause I love it when you look at me like that

So can I kiss you yet?

Over and over again

Again, again, again, again, again, again, again
Over again, over again

Sometimes, sometimes I don't know why we're fighting
You're probably right and I apologize
Want it to be over, have I ever told ya
That I love it when you look at me like that?
So can I kiss you yet?
Picture the moment inside my head
Playing it out like a vhs
Over and over again
So can I kiss you yet?
Throw myself to the bottom

 I'll be waiting getting impatient all alone
 Go out on the balcony, light myself a smoke
 Start talking to someone that I don't even know
 They just might invite me to see another spot
 You'll be trying to find me again but I'll be gone
 We'll forget each other, the night will carry on
 But that don't have to happen
 And that's not what I want, cos

 I know you can't stay here forever
 I know you've got friends in the bathroom stall
 Been wanna do this since I met you
 Can we just stay here for one more song
 If you leave now might forget you
 The memory fades when I'm way too gone
 Was hoping we'd wake up together
 Maybe just stay here for one more song
 Maybe just stay here for one more song

 Now imagine that you stay and we just keep it going
 Just another couple minutes in the vibe we're on
 Then I'll come with you where you're going and we'll both take one
 Feeling rushing over both of us

 So we'll go out on the balcony
 Light ourselves a smoke
 Start talking to people that we don't even know
 Maybe call a taxi, to hit another spot
 But this time you'll be with me, and yeah that's what I want, cos

I only ask that you watch over me don't stop protecting me
I miss you much never did you hold a grudge
And it gets hard to implement some of your teachings
But you watch
I'm slowly getting there
Later I'll get grayish hair and maybe
then I'll understand the visions for which once you cared
You never got to see me graduate from high school
And sometimes with your absence I do feel like this life's cruel
But now I've learned to move forward on my own tip
Learned to deal with things better finally got life's grip
I loved you dearly and I always did acknowledge
The fact that you were really proud to know I'd go to college
And a recent graduate just received my bachelor's
Learned to play the life game but next to you I'm amateur
Still the saddest on this planet with your absence
Didn't shed a tear at your funeral but fact is
That deep inside I was screaming 'til my soul left
And felt it leave my body in a relatively cold breath
And my cousin's doing good that's your daughter
After all she had you to idolize as her father
The fam can talk shit and say you were a drunk
But regardless of it all I just remember all your love
And I just made this song to tell you that I love you

When I know you are emoting and you're dazed
Is something broke inside you, cause at the moment
I'm lost and feeling that I don't know
If I'm losing you again

And when we fly tomorrow over the Java seas
And my younger match will be there with me
Cause they remind me of swimming out too far one day
When the coral was gone, but I didn't care anyway

I was running out of heart that day
I was running out of open road to you
And I know I was emoted, I was dazed
Is something broke inside me, cause at the moment
I'm lost and feeling that I don't know
If I'm losing you again

I'm running out of heartache

Sorry bout the bad times
Sorry bout the good things

Never have enough
Standing by the fire
Of that butterfly love
We're flipping on a one way
Laying on a long track
Hanging out a window
Knowing that we could crash
Forget all the facts

But I'm melancholy on Saturday night
The chandeliers gleaming mmmm
But it's not the same without you
By my side
So can you just get in the Uber
Say you're on the way
Bring a change of clothes
'Cause I know you might stay
I love the thought of us taking it slow
Let me know
When you're at the door
You could come thru
With no invitation
A little white wine
And deep conversations
I'm taking my time
Practicing the patience
I'm down for the ride
No reservations
Ain't no use in fighting mm
I know this spark is something that we both feel
The mix of perfect timing
And your dress under this lighting is so unreal
So can you just get a little closer
Say you're gonna stay
Melt into this couch
Until we fade away
And I love the thought of us taking it slow
Let me know
When you close the door
You could come thru
With no invitation
A little white wine
And deep conversations
I'm taking my time
Practicing the patience
I'm down for the ride
No reservations
Said you could come thru
With no invitation
A little white wine
And deep conversations
I'm taking my time
Practicing the patience
I'm down for the ride
No reservations"
618,San Francisco Street,Sun Rai,"Lost on the freeway
Well this must be LA
Tired and lonely
With no real place to stay
Is this the future and where I'm gonna be?
Last night it hit me
When I had this crazy dream
Of waking up
In your house
On a san francisco street
We tune out all the nasty weather
And it's all in front of you and me
You were intriguing
Just looking at a magazine
Like when I first saw you
Back in two thousand and three
Then you walked over
Said: ‘you don't have to be alone’
I don't have a crystal ball
There's no way that I could've known
(I'd be) waking up
In your house
On a san francisco street
We tune out all the nasty weather
And it's all in front of you and me
Waking up
In your house
On a san francisco street
We tune out all the nasty weather
And it's all in front of you
All in front of you and me oh oh
Yeah
Waking up
In your house
On a san francisco street
We tune out all the nasty weather
And it's all in front of you and me
Waking up
In your house
On a san francisco street
We tune out all the nasty weather
Then it's all in front of you
All in front of you and me
San francisco street
You and me
So only front of you and me
You and me
San francisco street you and me
Oh oh"
619,Hurt U,Devin Kennedy,"Think I met you before I met myself
You were laughing I was scared as hell
Think my jokes are better now, can't tell
I can never tell
Thought it'd only be a weekend thing
I was focused on my sleep and daydreams
But you hit me like a shot of caffeine
Yeah you woke me up
Morning dripping through your broke blinds
Bedside, come and kiss me
With your sleep eyes
Nothing I would ever do
To hurt you
Know how much it took to let me in
Know commitment can be hit or miss
Never want to need a second chance
No, I never do, for you, I'll be bulletproof
Cause you gave me your heart I could break it
But it tears me apart just to say it
Like falling from empire state to the pavement
No, I couldn't face it, no
Morning dripping through your broke blinds
Bedside, come and kiss me
With your sleep eyes
Nothing I would ever do
To lose the way you
Trust me with your secrets
Pillow talking
Wanna stay like this like
Nothing I would ever do
To hurt you
Yeah you know
Yeah you know
You're my favorite
To hurt u
Think I met you before I met myself
Kinda feels like I was someone else
You gave everything that I never felt
Oh, no I never felt
Morning dripping through your broke blinds
Bedside, come and kiss me
With your sleep eyes
Nothing I would ever do
To lose the way you
Trust me with your secrets
Pillow talking
Wanna stay like this like
Nothing I would ever do
To hurt you
Yeah you know, yeah you know
You're my favorite
Hurt you

Was in the dark when I'm dueling with fire
How many thoughts would it take to be rounded?
Oh my darker times
Hold on my memories
I need your lullaby
Sing about your blind side
I breathe out all of my sighs
Somehow I'll see them float
You reached out all of my nights
Someday we'll see how they bloom
If it wasn't your voice
I would never be on time
Then I broke all my rules
Will you lead me to other sides?"

Let's go back to basics
Tilt your head towards the sky
See the spaceships
Long before we were stressing over payslips
Mum's were getting facelifts
We were in and out of phases
Through our childhood shame to waste it
We used to live adjacent
Party in the basement
Used to chill with me and Frank
But now you live with Jason
What's he saying?
Just send him my regards
I really hope you're not too far
As long as I've got marshmallow clouds above me
No one in this world ever understood me
We need the universe to be as it should be
As long as I've got marshmallow clouds above me
No one in this world ever understood me
You don't have to feel it now just trust me
Yeah we're good
Yeah we're good
Yeah we're good
Yeah we're good
Yeah we're good
Yeah we could
Yeah we could
Yeah we could
Yeah we could
Yeah we could
So many arguments over nothing
I've stopped counting
We made movements so massive
We moved mountains
She was disco she was bebop
She was soul
She was new wave
Make a young man feel old
My etiquette and my big dreams
And my attitude problem
My loose ends and my mistakes
I thought she could solve them
I was spaced out and I was face down
Out of control
She was red hot
Made my pale skin feel cold
Say you feel a little blue sometimes
Finding it hard to get up
For a job that you hate
Got your boss on your case
Can't relate
Swear they've not got a clue sometimes
Giving the best parts away
Losing strength by the day
Just hold up I'm a junction away
As long as I've got marshmallow clouds above me
No one in this world ever understood me
We need the universe to be as it should be
As long as I've got marshmallow clouds above me
No one in this world ever understood me
You don't have to feel it now just trust me

Let me say it once more

hey it's nice to meet you

649,Border Line,King Krule,"You know I tried so hard
My feelings just can’t discard
The way in which I fell into
Your heart was never what I once knew
Lately my skull has kept
Dividing lines deep set and paved
Two paths too wander through to depart
And sever desires to pursue

And the soul chokes
To cause the tide
To enforce divide
This whole devotion has morphed in time
I’ll escort her mind to solve my crimes
Reach slow motion to con the mind

See here I trace my steps
To where my senses left
And rain had turn my sense to mush
This slowly seeping straight through the crust
Now let these stains of gunk slip down
To where my head once sunk and drowned
Just await for a while to see
My body has merged to the deep krule sea

But my soul floats
Adrift thoughtless minds, distorted lines
The soul is broken down, borderlines
To cause the tide, to enforce divide
This whole devotion has morphed in time
I’ll escort her mind to solve my crimes
Reach slow motion, con the mind

So scorn divine and mourn the pride
The cold has spoken, draw the line"
650,Sinking,Clairo,"Every night
Think of things I can't do or haven't done
And does it make me weak?
Sometimes I feel like I can't breathe
Is that all you see in me?
Don't you wait for something more
I'll still be sinking to the floor
Oh you can't help me
Now I'm all alone
Is it my doing? Is it my doing? Mmm
Outside it's getting colder
Why does it feel like
I'm older than I asked to be?
But when you say my name
It all falls away so tenderly
Don't you wait for something more
I'll still be sinking to the floor
Oh you tried to help me
Why do I feel so cold?
Is it my doing? Is it my doing?
(Ah)
Is it my doing? Is it my doing? (Ah)
Is it my doing? Oh (Ah)
Mmm is it my doing? (Ah)
Mmm"

이유를 찾다가 너 빼고는 없네
나는 사는 것만으로 버거워서
네가 머무를 때 웃을 수 있었어
요즘 내 방은 세상의 전부 같아
네 향수 냄새가 남은 옷을 입고
거울에 사라지지 않는 모습은
어쩌면 죽은 지 오래된 것 같아
아직도 그대 닮은 것만 보면
잊으려 애쓴 것들이 떠올라서
집에서 날 기다릴 고독이 두려워
난 들어가지 못하고 발만 구르고 있네
처음도 아닌 것들이 처음같이 아프네
발밑의 땅을 손으로
다 까질 만큼 깎아내려서
비가 내리면 네가 고개를 숙여도
마주칠 수 있는 하늘을 만들었어
마음의 색을 고르고 말하지 못했던 걸 그려서
이젠 닿지 않을 네가 알 수 있게
작은 하늘에 걸어두지
날 데려가 준다면
더 큰 구름이 우리 머리로
우리가 도망쳐 떠난
땅이 눈에 작아지네
바람이 우리를 끌고
원하지 않는 곳으로
데려가도 나는 좋은데
햇빛에 꿈은 매번 여기서 멈춰버렸네"

Told me you're obsessed
With everything that I do

Only coming from you
Why are you waking up next to me
We don't even touch we just fall asleep
Said that you've been
Dreaming about this day
Now that I am here you don't feel a way
Girl you're a vision of my design
Led me to believe that you were mine
Maybe you just need a place to stay
Someone to help you on your way
How could you fake it
When you knew I was naked
Told me you're falling
Told me you're obsessed
With everything that I do
Feeling the pressure
Baby know the pressure's
Only coming from you
Told me you're falling
Told me you're obsessed
With everything that I do
Feeling the pressure
Baby know the pressure's
Only coming from you
Pressure's only coming from you"

Somebody told me
There’d be trouble at home
‘Cause we never talk a lot
When we spend time alone
So how are we supposed to know
Know when something is wrong
Well, we’ve got a right to communicate
It keeps a happy home

And no one does it like me
And no one but you
Has that kind of whip appeal on me

Keep on whippin’ on me
Work it on me
Whip all your sweet sad lovin’ on me
Keep on whippin’ on me
Work it on me
Whip all your sweet sad lovin’ on me

When we go to work
How the day seems so long
The only thing I think about
Can’t wait ‘til we get home
‘Cause we got a way of talking
And it’s better than words
It’s the strangest kind of relationship
Oh, but with us it always works

And no one does it like me
And no one but you
Has that kind of whip appeal on me

Whatever you want
It’s alright with me
‘Cause you’ve got that whip appeal
So work it on me
It’s better than love
Sweet as can be
You’ve got that whip appeal
So whip it on me

Keep on whippin’ on me
Work it on me
Whip all your sweet sad lovin’ on me
Keep on whippin’ on me
Work it on me

Pouring out my heart just wasn't part of the plan
But I know
This love is for sure
And now I can open up without feeling insecure
Never knew that we could become
more than just friends
I was out of luck but you still gave me a chance
I won't go
Cus with you I'm home
When the flowers are blooming girl
You just can't ignore
Suddenly I'm not afraid to show
I'm taking the past and letting it go
I'll make you believe
Just know that I wont ever leave you rest assured
Cus I
I know that forever's not enough
But I'll be your side when time's get rough
My heart is all yours to keep
I'm yours for the taking
Cuz you're all I've been waiting for
Rest assured
Used to get all nervous
When I first held your hand
Little did I know
You'd turn me to a better man
Mi Amor
It's you I adore
And all of this time
I spent with you got me wanting more
Can't believe I used to walk around and pretend
Til you came around and let me be who I am
There's no way
That I wouldn't stay
And girl you should know that I still feel the same
Suddenly I'm not afraid to show
I'm taking the past and letting it go
I'll make you believe
Just know that I wont ever leave you rest assured

Boy this evening was it only me
Feeling completly down to be open
Down to be open for some satisfaction
Didn't want to say yes, afraid of your reaction
I knew it was wrong, for feeling this way
Especially the thought of givin' in on the first date
Couldn't let go, it stayed on my mind
At the end of the night I had to decide, I was thinkin'...

I should make a move but I won't
I know your probly thinkin' something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night

I should make a move but I won't
I know your probly thinkin' something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I wanna get down, but not the first night

[Monica:]
We were chillin' watching your T.V.
I felt it was comin' the closer that you got to me
Wanted to touch you, wanted to kiss you
And some how in one night, discover I love you
Felt so right, but it felt so wrong
And look how we're carryin' on
Tryin' to say things to get me to stay
But my watch is telling me it's getting to late, I'm 
thinkin'...

I should make a move but I won't
I know your probly thinkin' something is wrong
Knowing if I do that it won't be right
I don't get down on the first night

If you, wnat me, you got to know me
And if you want my love (My love) you gotta wait my love

711,Ottolenghi,Loyle Carner,"I was sat up on the train
Staring out the window at the rain (Aye)
I heard this little lady must've felt the pain
Ask her mum if the blazing
Sun'll ever shine again
I felt ashamed feel the same
Not her mother though
Nah started to laugh
Got her son involved (Aye)
Mention the past like a running joke
And told her 'without all the rain
There's no stunning growth'
Close ah to everything
And nothing picture past
The honeymoon and bluffing
Where the wooden spoon is only cuffing
Shorter the discussion
But the roots can't manoeuvre out of nothing
I've been suffering these dreamy days (Ah)
Remedy and lust don't hold
Any memories of us
Rather hold you everyday
Until the memories are dust
Yo we only caught the train
Cause you know I hate the bus
Never get enough
Born and raised
Made attempts to crawl away
Find a way to exist
And hide your face some relate
Leave everything in yesterday
They ask about the bible I was reading
Told them that the title was misleading
Labelled it jerusalem
But really its for cooking middle eastern
I could see your mind was changing
With the seasons shady for a reason (Ah)
They will start decreasing
Leaving like the orange in the evening
It was creeping through the clouds
But now I'm proud to see
The images releasing
I just wish the little lady could've seen it
But she was dreaming (Ah)
Reckon she's standing
With her mum saying to her
'Look mother here's the sun' rooted
In the moment til the memories are done
So I sit and start to wonder
On the woman she'll become
Wonder if I'll have a son or a daughter
Ones that I brought up never strong never
Telling me to run
Never tried to find a sum
Tryna get it done yo I wonder
If she'll ever be as clever as her mum one
Born and raised
Made attempts to crawl away
Find a way to exist
And hide your face some relate
Leave everything in yesterday
Born and raised
Made attempts to crawl away
Find a way to exist
And hide your face some relate
Leave everything in yesterday"

It felt too easy
I thought it couldn't get any better
It seemed the summer would last forever
The sky is still new I know we're cool
But I still feel
Summertime blue
The sky is too blue to feel bad now
Fell in love with the summertime you
The sun is too bright to feel sad now
Picturing your summer eyes summer thighs
Turning in to summer lies summer cries
Fell in love with the summertime you
It feels pretty good to be sad
Good to be sad now
Summer games we love to play
Something changed
In the way you look at me
In between the monkey puzzle trees
You and I
Now you wanna patronize me
Somehow it doesn't surprise me
Cause' you're like me

It's 5am and I have to go

Friends tell me I look so dead
I think they're seeing through my disguise
They know
They know where I've been

내 목숨은 아무래도 상관없어
우리 울음을 짓고 매일 기워낸다면

낭비되는 피부, 온도
그대로 날 안아들 것 같은
always me, the others mean

나 아직도 네가 오길 기다려
너의 지친 모습은 보고 싶지 않은데
언제나 너에게 기억될 수 있게
네게만 어리광 부리는 거야

다음을 기약 한 말도 몇 번이고 어긴 약속
오지 않는 하루의 꿈을 난 꿔 (혼자서)
바삐 떠나던 네게서 꾹 삼켜 왔던 말들
한 번 나를 안아줘 언제나 나를 사랑해줘

Cause all of this got me wondering
What's got everybody stressing 
Why they tryin to outrun each other
Don't they know that the sky goes on forever 

Wanna be like Pluto
You can call me weirdo
Don't mind the periphery 

Wanna be like Van Gogh  
Keep in check my ego 
Make art from my misery

또 별이 보여 별이 보여

다 나란 존재니깐 뭐 I don't care
얘넨 또 뭘 했고 쟤넨 잘 나간대
물어본 적도 없는데 왜?
그냥 내 tempo에 맞춰 가는 거지 뭐
이리 치이고 치일 바엔 차라리 I'm out
할래 날 내버려둬

Forgive me when I forget

How so and so is better

A sunny afternoon
I was on my way to buy some flowers for you
Thought that we could hide away
In a corner of the heath
There's never been someone
who's so perfect for me
But I got over it and I said
""Give me something old and red""
I pay for it more than I did back then
There's just no getting through
Without you
A bottle of rouge
Just me and you
Sitting in the garden, I'm a couple glasses in
I was tryna count up all the places we've been
You're always there, so don't overthink

Pack my bag up sick of home
Never homesick down that road
In my room by the moon with no ceiling
I was driving in a van I was older than
I and I plus five heading Kanye West
Off the tip of Argentina
Better than drowning in gin
Ain't got no saint to blame instead
Of my reflection so I dreamt
I packed it all like Anderson
To end up where it all began
I was going up the coast
In a minivan that broke
Like my voice when I told you I was leaving
Pack my bag up sick of home
Never homesick down that road
In my room by the moon with no ceiling
Used to want to live in Brooklyn
With a view from my apartment
No more homies on the block like
On the corner like a stoplight yeah
On the coast they never lose it
Never showed up for the showbiz
To get back to the beginning
When I knew why I was singing
I was going up the coast
In a minivan that broke
Like my voice when I told you I was leaving
Pack my bag up sick of home
Never homesick down that road
In my room by the moon with no ceiling
Brown sugah she called me
The last time we spoke
This hard rive gone save me
She answered I know

 I can't help it I miss you
 And I hate it that I miss you when you're gone
 I know we have our issues
 The minute I leave I forget them all

 Without you it's boring
 Someone should have warned me
 Love is so annoying
 Every time I get a message
 Hope it's you that's calling
 Though I might ignore it
 Love is so annoying

 I'll go round to your house
 And all we'll do is talk
 Then drive around for hours
 For no reason at all
 I guess I miss the way that
 The way it was before
 When we were just so young
 Not dumb and immature

 I'm mad that I still need you
 And I hate that I don't want somebody new
 Cos we still have our issues
 But when its good, oh boy, it's so damn good

 Without you it's boring
 Someone should have warned me
 Love is so annoying
 Every time I get a message
 Hope it's you that's calling
 Though I might ignore it
 Love is so annoying

 And I can't lie
 Your mine and love's unconditional
 I can't lie

Once I fall from the cliff
It's hard to start a new
It's closer to me than it is to my rear view
Damn I think I am scared
Will I bounce back soon?
I know it
Takes time but I can't believe

While I'm lost at the sea
Oh I hope
That it shows
Oh it
It turns out that
I mistook when I was off my feet
Oh I hope
That it shows
I can't
Fight back with a bottle I'm
So full of shit when I just say I'm fine
I'm pissed off at my friends online
The bitter taste of a black sunshine
It's bout the balance how you pace it
But maxbe I should find
A way to just embrace it
I really hate to see the colors
slowly fading
I can foresse that
Theres a mess that it created
I know it
Takes time but I can't believe
I've been riding out the waves
While I'm lost at sea

That it shows

It turns out that I can't retrieve
Any breath that
I mistook when I was off my feet

That it shows

And lost my touch
It's way harder now
Is it enough?
I think I fell out

glowing amidst the crowd-like scene
and then going away

so
when i
saw you standing there
shining, oh so bright

i lost 
a piece of me, 
looking at your bright light 
maybe we could stay far

i ain't so great
but i'll change when i'm with you
'cause when i'm with you
i feel different

like feathers
lifting me up from the ground
tearing me down
and just take me away in your arms

you are so lovely
and i can't help but be sorry
keep me at a distance
don't let my shadow
lurk atop of your light

and just trust me
this is for the better
you know me
better than anybody 

so trust me 
maybe
so run away from me

never ever
felt this way before
i used to be afraid
you've changed me
your smile's so bright 
it's making me feel helpless
and i think you've changed me for life,
you're putting a shine on my face

i ain't so great
but i'll change when i'm with you
'cause when i'm with you
i feel different

like feathers
lifting me up from the ground
tearing me down

get us through the storms and clouds that we pass through, ooh

for you there's not a limit on sacrifice
there's not a thing that ever would be too much
I'd risk it all for love

Wonder if I really wanna roll that dice, yeah, yeah

Wonder why she never tell me where she's from
Wonder why she always wanna make me run

I heard that she killed a man out in Hollywood
Now we're holding hands, pray to god she's good
But she's evil, that's all I know about her

I wonder how she got this way?
Wonder why she never has a lot to say
Hmm, hmm, mom's to blame
It's always back home where the monsters lay
Hmm, hmm, been through hell

Tryna save you, I'ma kill myself

There goes the floor beneath my feet
A stack of empty crates
Giving out under me
I'll take one more sleepless night
Then book the cheapest flight
Buy my head some space to clear
It's no time to cut and run
But I can't think about what I've done
To get me here
Two miles off the ground
With no clouds to be seen
Give me some air that's cold and clean
Love can't bring me down
When I've taken myself
Way out of reach
We can smooth the folds
But you know this whole thing's on the slide
Trying to split the change
Into numbers that don't divide
I'll take one more sleepless night
Then I'm on the cheapest flight
Give my head a chance to clear
It's no time to cut and run
But I can't think about what I've done
To get me here
Two miles off the ground
With no clouds to be seen
Give me some air that's cold and clean

Wanna feel something new

Nice to meet you
It’s the sequel
Already been here so
We don’t need no read through
Nice to meet you
Am I see through
Because you know my thoughts 
Before I can say it’s you
I can say it’s you
before I can say it’s you, you

But now they’re all gone

Birds were made for singing
Waking up to no sound
No sound

Gotta learn how to let someone in to hold
It take time, gotta trust who I let control

832,I Wonder Why,Joesef,"Carry on
 Look at my phone
 Set it down
 I'm all alone
 Get my shoes
 Take a breath
 See your face
 In everything
 Out the door
 Don't know what for
 Maybe there is
 Something more
 I close my eyes
 I travel miles
 I'm still lost
 I wonder why

 I can't seem to get you out my head
 Feel your kiss with every single breath

 I've drank the wine
 I've took the drugs
 But nothing ever
 Is enough
 I don't eat
 Haven't for days
 Punish myself
 In different ways
 Maybe then
 I'll finally know
 What it was
 That made you go
 I look up
 Into the the sky
 I ask myself
 And I wonder why

 I can't seem to get you out my head
 Feel your kiss with every single breath

 Me and my brother, we were cool when we were younger
 Until the pull of all that drugging took him under
 Nothing could satisfy the darkness in his hunger
 Yo, 'cause first you feel the lightning go
 But then you hear the thunder
 It was louder than you ever could imagine
 Couldn't fathomed the pain till the day you see it happen
 Yo, I was sitting in a shitty pub in Clapham
 Trying to find a way to tame a fire breathing dragon like

 I can't seem to get you out my head
 Feel your kiss with every single breath, single breath
 I can't seem to get you out my head
 Feel your kiss with every single breath"

Listenin' to songs from '76

Late nights, feelings on a rooftop
Spinnin' and my hair's still drippin'

Of all the joy that a boy can bring
Moonlight, cigarettes, card machines
Spendin' your money on girls and weed
Cross your fingers, tell me it's forever
Could we make it into September?
Leave me on the porch, take back your sweater
I'll be so cold when it hits December

I do takes me further from you
Three boys would work 
if I wasn't so tethered to you
What should I do
I cant even choose
Tethered to you
You pray to god that it would leave
It won't leave
All that you feel for me
It wont be light
It wont feel right
My hand around your neck 
that your tortured by
Spend a lot of time with you I can't let go
I know theres some things you can't speak
but thoughts of a third make me weak weak
I don't want to

Don't know a thing about astrology

I wish I could be a make believer
I need a little bit of faith in my life

Oh I've been looking for a soulmate
For way too long
I'd even settle for a heartbreak
Just so I could feel something at all
I was looking for love in the wrong places
'Till you made all my dreams come true
Thought I was looking for a soulmate
But I was looking for you

I don't know if this is the right way of thinking
Perfect is what I deserve
Do I got some nerve? 
Oh I've been waiting for some kind of sign

Tomorrow might have something better
I'll just wait and see
Maybe today has given me all that I need
Maybe it was you all this time

Two lights in the sky
Two planets in motion
You and I

I only wanna be wherever you are

Don't worry please don't worry
Baby don't worry bout me"

886,Into You,TEEKS,"When you're right there
It's so hard not to stare
You're like a piece of art
When your face looks like that
I don't know how to act
You make me fall apart
And I want you to know that
I need you so bad
That it hurts when you're not around
So I'm singing this song to you
Oh, look what you've done
You touched me and I fell apart
And now, bright as the sun
I'm crashing like a falling star
In, into you, into you
Sometimes, I feel
Like you can't be real
An angel sent from the sky
And when you are near
The whole world disappears
And I get lost in those eyes
Oh, I want you to know that
I need you so bad
That it hurts when you'rе not around
So I'm singing this song to you
Oh, look what you've done
You touched mе and I fell apart
And now, bright as the sun
I'm crashing like a falling star
In, into you, into you
In, into you, into you
I don't wanna be anywhere
Anywhere that's not here beside you
Mmm
I don't wanna be anywhere
Anywhere that's not here beside you
Oh
I don't wanna be anywhere
Anywhere that's not here beside you
Oh
I don't wanna be anywhere
Anywhere that's not here beside you
Oh, look what you've done
You touched me and I fell apart
And now, bright as the sun
I'm crashing like a falling star
In, into you, into you
In, into you, into you"
888,Love Quotes,Jenevieve,"Blast off I'm gone was it only just a dream?
Left him like an old fling
Feels like silly puddy
Troubled waters deep and muddy
Never trust another mother's son
Lookin' back now see what we've become
'Cause I can't really tell what you've been on
Sometimes it's like autopilot
And we can't see eye to eye
Out of sight apologies come too late
Tell me how to act but please it's not your place
Feels like I've been with the wolves all my life
Feels like you've been seein' stars am I right?
I don't need somebody to hold
When it gets cold
And I shiver
I don't need somebody to blame
Someone to frame
Up in pictures
Now I know how you found your way in (Way in)
Nothing you can do will ever harm me
You can even see me at the weigh ins (Weigh ins)
You're not on my level baby sorry
Out of sight apologies come too late
Tell me how to act but please it's not your place

I don't need somebody to hold
When it gets cold
And I shiver (Oh oh oh oh)
I don't need somebody to blame
(Oh oh oh yeah yeah)
Someone to frame
Up in pictures
It's a mad world in a mad way (Okay)
Backstage and it's sold out
You can keep up the charade baby
Baby I don't need you we've fallen out
It's a mad world in a mad way (Okay)
Backstage and you're not allowed
(Why you gotta do that way?)
You're not standin' in my way baby

890,Lonely,Taquirah,"What did I do to make you go
And leave me lonely
Who could I be to make you wanna stay
If only I could be your one and only
Hoping that I can remove how I feel today
I've been around
Chasing you
You weigh me down but I'm on top
I've seen the ground
And I won't stop
Cause baby please destroy my dreams
And give me love
Cause I got need
Gotta let you go
Let you go
Let you go
Let you goo what did I do to make you yell
And leave me lonely
Who can I be to make you wanna stay
To make you stay
What can I even do to get you to hold me
Why am I blue?
What can I do not to feel this way?
Cause baby I made you
But how can I save ya
Cause it seem like you hate me
Boy won't tell me
I need you to love me now
We can't be moving slow
Boy let me love you
I make you feel alright
Why you make me feel so

891,Beautiful Life (feat. sky),Jeremy Passion(제레미 패션),"At last
We've found some time
To be together
Just you and me
Caught up in life
Keeping up with Joneses
While you're my priority
Take my hand
We can slow dance don't need music
And talk like it's our first date
What a beautiful life we've made
I wouldn't change a thang
Our love has grown
But it would be
A mistake
If we didn't take a while
To stop and smile
And remember how it all started
Call me naive
A hopeless romantic
But I still think you're fine
Before the bills the car
the house and the baby
Sugar you were all mine all mine
Take my hand
And we could revisit the place
Where we shared our first kiss
What a beautiful life we've made
I wouldn't change a thang
Our love has grown
But it would be
A mistake
If we didn't take a while
To stop and smile
And remember how it all started
Through the years
We have made so many memories
And I am still madly in love 3000
Way past the honeymoon but
Don't care that we've grown up
You make our love feel brand new
What a beautiful life we've made
I wouldn't change a thang
Our love has grown
But it would be
A mistake
If we didn't take a while
To stop and smile
And remember
What a beautiful life we've made
I wouldn't change a thang
Our love has grown
But it would be
A mistake
If we didn't take a while
To stop and smile
And remember how it all started"

The moon it knows I
Don't want you to leave
I think you're divine I
Left the old me
Just to be with you I try
To be free with you
I'd fall back down to earth
So what you want?
You're killing me softly
Know that you love me
Maybe I'm honestly falling too soon
I'm happy we're grown now
Don't gotta love you on the low now
Can you hit me when you're home?
And I'll come running back to you
I need you to be
Myself again I
Need to believe
I'm worth the work
I need you to see
Parts of me I hide
Parts of me
I hide away for someone else to find
Of all the stars in the sky that burn
You are the one to bring me back to earth
See you remind where I came from
So when you're done with work
Just hit me boy I'll slide
Mediate on you just for the high
Think we met before another life
So when you want a round two
I could meet you outside
You're killing me softly
Know that you love me
Maybe I'm honestly falling too soon
I'm happy we're grown now
Don't gotta love you on the low now
Can you hit me when you're home?
And I'll come running back to you
I need you to be
Myself again I
Need to believe
I'm worth the work
I need you to see
Parts of me I hide
Parts of me
I hide away for someone else to find

893,I Don't Know You,Noni,"Baby I know we've went through
So many different fates and shades of blue
I can still feel you but what about you?
How about me? Can you still feel me too?
We've been away from each other for a while
How can I forget the time we said good bye?
Now you became someone I don't recognize
I wish it's all just lies it's almost like
I don't know you
(Every single word you say
they sound the same but nothing at all)
Could it be true?
(I don't wanna run away
but everytime you get so terrifyin')
I have tried to bear
When you need me there
It's all too much
I don't ask for you to change
I just need some time to adapt
You don't mean to scare nobody
I know ‘cause I
Still have a bit of trust in you
How can I make you realize
that you've lost those sparks?
(The ones) I used to see right through your eyes
(Who did you give yourself away to?)
It's so hard for me lately
To see you change because
It ain't for the better
Oh I
I don't know you (Really I don't want to run away)
(Every single word you say
they sound the same but nothing at all)
Could it be true?

896,To Lose Someone,Joy Crookes(조이 크룩스),"Tell me where your head has gone
Why do you hide your mouth from me?
I'd pray to a different god for you
Tell me I'm your ride or die
Anything I could believe
I would like to live as one with you
I could let you break these laws
I once made for me
If you want to 'cause I want you
But the trouble is
If I give what I've got
Would you hold it up against me?
If I show what I'm not
Will I hurt you like they hurt me?
What I fear I become
Every word will be undone
To love someone is to lose someone
Power in the weakest way
Thought I had this set for me
Maybe there's no playing God with you
If there's no turning back
You could repeat my past
Then what would I do?
I don't want to
But I want you
So the trouble is
If I give what I've got
Would you hold it up against me?
If I show what I'm not
Will I hurt you like they hurt me?
What I fear I become
Every word will be undone
To love someone is to lose someone
I wanna let go
I wanna live for two
I wanna be wrong
I wanna learn to lose
I got to get down
With nothing left to prove
And if I got you
I had to make it through
And I ain't scared of trouble
'Cause you're worth the trouble
Now I don't approve
What I used to choose
If I give what I've got
Would you hold it up against me?
If I show what I'm not
Will I hurt you like they hurt me?
What I fear I become
Every word will be undone
To love someone is to lose someone"
898,Earth Angel (feat. Cise Star),Marcus D(마커스 디),"You just a radiant princess in my radius
The way you oscillate in my mind within circadian
Rhythms in time, you must be alien with angel eyes
Otherworldly presence who presently is so alive
Melodic goddess, forever modest, beautifully honest
I must be on it cause maybe baby you just a sonnet
Super intelligent, you is the Fifth Element
Diligent superstar supernova sky messages, telling me
When your mother was heavy with your pregnancy
She was visited by heavenly beings saying Legacy
Right here not of this world girl you sincere
Moving along space with a grace and no fear
Gliding through landscapes, fresh faced with no tears
Coming to grips you are my starship so come here
Taking me to galaxies and comets
Beyond the stars baby when you calling I’m to follow cause..
You just an earth angel, fall from sky thank you
The one that I adore of course never an angle
Breaking all the laws of gravity when you came through
Fingerprints in your skin cause God directly made you
Inspirational even the way you breathe is graceful
Bring it back to the line, everything you do is tasteful
Open book in your actions, porcelain never plastic
A lady in the streets but in bed doing gymnastics
And smile after... Genuine you a master
The way you working your way into my heart fantastic
Never a spastic, baby girl you a magnet
Drawing me in closer I’m just lost within your actions 'cause
You just an earth angel, fall from sky thank you
The one that I adore of course never an angle
Breaking all the laws of gravity when you came through
Fingerprints in your skin cause God directly made you
You just an earth angel, fall from sky thank you
The one that I adore of course never an angle
Breaking all the laws of gravity when you came through
Fingerprints in your skin cause God directly made you
Look at you standing there, you bad and you know it glare
Coming off the light that you shine baby without a care
Supernova with shoulders with the eyes of the Beholder
Your body solar and I’m the sun so come in closer
Astrological signs made with the stars in your eyes
I can’t even deny you better than any surprise
You got me going and holding onto the moment
Honey you own it so show it, Earth angel you chosen and go
You just an earth angel, fall from sky thank you
The one that I adore of course never an angle
Breaking all the laws of gravity when you came through
Fingerprints in your skin cause God directly made you"

Watchin her drivin by in her new whip so fly
Wish she could sing me a lullaby
To scoop her I've got to try
In her eyes
There's a flame that burns right through my soul
Can't pretend to be cool about to lose my control
Yeah I know she's got plenty
Admirers she's got many
Like an exotic fantasy into a frenzy she sends me
Wow I have to sit down and gather my wits now
I wanna caress those hips now
Wanna kiss those lips now

Touch the brakes and go slow oh no
Dust them out with the one quick solo

Like the scent of incense
Go to lengths to win
Then me a flex me wings and
Dem a try fi swing
But couldn't I me sing
Pon any riddim they feeling it now
High pon the ceiling and not coming down
Fighting the feeling that life is a dream
But then living is
Death when it comes back around
So we just live for the sound
Round here we make the sun rays soak in

With the third eye open bruh

Focus on my wealth but it's you I'm really missing

Baby no no, baby no no no
Two things
I still hate you but I really can't think
Funny how I don't remember where all of my things are now
(I'm trying to forget yeah I'm sorry)
I don't even know how I got here

Said I only wanna be somebody
Said I only wanna be your baby

Oh I'm not sure

Said I only wanna be somebody
Said I only wanna be your baby
I've been thinking all about your body
Oh I'm not sure

Cos you left something on your phone
And is that something on your nose
So you text me tell me it's Rome
You said come but just on your own
Then you changed your mind and said no
Well the flowers tend to get old
If it is what it is then I'll go
Maybe you just come to my show?

Cos I know it ain't you
14 hours on a plane
Cos I know it ain't you (ah, fuck)
Sunsets on the other side
Cos I know it ain't true
No top with the same jeans
Cos I know it ain't true
What the hell are we doing?

If you can find the time
(I just mean something to you)
Then I could only tell you
(You just mean something to me)
You could only tell me things
(You just told me what it means and)
That make you feel important
(My hands ain't even that clean)
You keep doing things that I cannot complain
(You were more into Celine, I was more into your dreams)
If only it was better than the first one that you came with
(Loving you's not what it seems and everything's hard to believe in)

Said I only wanna be somebody
Said I only wanna be your baby
I've been thinking all about your body
Oh I'm not sure

Said I only wanna be somebody
Said I only wanna be your baby
I've been thinking all about your body

I love the way it flows
I love the way it grows
There's something in this sound
That takes me far
It's like a special song
Can move my mood along
But I cannot say
You're here through my guitar
She told me add a bassline
And everything will be alright
She told me that the groove is mine
It will take us through the night
And where I'll go
Can't explain I'll never know
But it's beautiful
You can't take this away from me
All the way I hear the melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me
You can't take this away from me
All the way I hear the melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me
I love the way it sings
All the joy that it brings
Remember skating down
The road towards the park?
I can never say no
You with that summer glow
The music is me sun when winter stars
She told me add a bassline
And everything will be alright
She told me that the beat is mine
It will rock us through the night
And where I'll go
Can't explain I'll never know
But it's beautiful
You can't take this away from me

The waves bring clarity
Running through me

Oh the way I hear the melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me
(Yeah it's running through me)
Yo I wear notes like coats blues like doos
Warmth in the rhythm soul that glues
That bounce to my bones
The jazz in my spine
The hop is my home rap is my grind
I'm grinding on the backside
Of life we dance
She do me a chance
Her hands in my pants
Actually my pockets holding me tight
Whispering a dream
I could hold in the night
Blood tight a rhythm
That's throbbing my vein
Wake up and write it on the pack of pains
Like church the organ will invite the tears
(Like birth) the crying
Let you know I'm here
Held by the song that gave me a name
Dressed by the verse that gave me a claim
(It's just bass in the line)
Safe to inhale and if you live well
Be long your years and the stay you'll be
A timeless octave to play for the tree
That's rooted in every single nerve in me
The nerve of he who ignores the key
And use it it opens the mind to be free
Whenever you're hot headed
Pours you a breeze
Beneath the clouds you're allowed to see
In clarity through harmony
Someone harming me
That won't be done
I stand protected by the laws of fun
I am perfected to the rhymes I've run
Walk it this way
And leave the party stunned
This music it launched me with no aim
I've landed on some plane
Where I am I can't explain
Or never know but it's beautiful so
You can't take this away from me
All the way I hit the melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me (come on y'all)
You can't take this away from me
All the way I hit the melody
The waves bring clarity
Running through me"

Still swear I could feel it again (oh)

I'll be your baby doll
And your bodyguard if you tell me to
I'll try to make it all not as hard
If you let me through
I ain't sign up for no bullshit
I told my baby that I'm bulletproof
Hands made me take two sips
All things I couldn't do
The cops come then we dip baby
Back when we was just friends baby
Shit man you was just a baby
And I turned on you like mother nature
Try to think about the blueprint
All the shit that you told me not to do
Was breaking it worth it in the end
If I'm just a vision you come to?
It's all peaches and cream
If you left your love I'll be right
I'll be your baby doll
And your bodyguard if you tell me to
I'll try to make it all not as hard
If you let me through
I ain't tryna get the roof bent
Back then when I would ride with you
Short trips doing backflips
Mesmerized me led me to the truth
Atlanta we was kids baby
Special moments with my friends baby
Sippin' on some fuckin' gin baby
And you wonder why we ain't win baby
This year I ain't takin' no pics
I'm tryna get with the motion
I'm tryna get a promotion
Window shoppin' 'til they closin'
It's all peaches and cream

Don't let me stay on your mind
Adderall and cheap wine
Just to stay awake in conversation
We were always so damn insecure
So how could we ever know for sure
Disregard the way I know we feel
That would make this city way too real

If we bump into each other 
On a crowded street 
It's not us no more It's just you and me
We're just strangers in passing casually
It's not us no more It's just you and me

Shirt on my back with the rips
Gems in my golden necklace
You didn't give me none of this
There's nothing for me to miss
We were too young on the day we met
How could we say we would not forget
And in the shadows there's a place for us
Somewhere hidden they can't find our love
Don't let 'em know

If we bump into each other 
On a crowded street
It's not us no more It's just you and me
We're just strangers in passing casually
It's not us no more It's just you and me

Eazy and these days it's just you and me
This shit is dead and gone, 
it's not what it used to be
Someone give a eulogy
I know I'm hard headed and 
I might of acted foolishly
But you the one to hold us down usually
We was in a limbo
But of all people you ain't have to fuck 
with him though
That was my homie I had gave y'all the intro
Some things fall apart and some
get thrown out the window 
Remember when we first met 
we might've been too young
But we was from The Bay so 
we both was going too dumb
I used to be the one for you now 
you got a new one
So till the next lifetime, 
maybe we can do some'n Eazy

If we bump into each other

957,NIGHTS LIKE THESE,Benson Boone,"The lights are low
My hands are cold against the wheel
And you still have my coat
Eyes are lost in the fog without you here
And I can't see the road
Now I'm standing at your door
And I hope that you're not home
So I can get used to being alone
On nights like these
when my willpower's weak
I'm gonna call so just let it ring
I'll drive these streets
don't come looking for me
If you're letting go then I'm gonna need
More nights like these
I fight the Earth to write the words up
in my head
That I know I shouldn't send
(That I know I shouldn't send)
It's hard to heal
when I keep stealing glances at your picture
So I look away again
On nights like these
when my willpower's weak
I'm gonna call so just let it ring
I'll drive these streets
don't come looking for me
If you're letting go then I'm gonna need
More nights like
You gotta let me drown
You gotta let me fall apart
Without you here to catch me
And if you're not around
I gotta learn to face the dark
'Cause days turn into nights like these
Nights like these (Nights like these)
'Cause days turn into nights like this

The keys said no more
This little love dream
Never worked for me
Left everything and got colors

ride from Miami
Speaking three languages 

two I'm understanding

Rafters fireworks and fast turns
Famous last words
Now it's just you and me 
the space between us
Yeah yeah yeah
Now it's just you and me 
the space between us

Surely might be execution
Getting drive-by 20 cupids
Caught a comet off the roof
It landed at your door
Views are changing new directions
Little moments simple blessings
Call my momma said it happened
Never hit like this before

Yeah this girl got off a plane
 ride from Miami

Rafters fireworks and fast turns
Famous last words
Now it's just you and me
 the space between us
Yeah yeah yeah
Now it's just you and me 
the space between us

I think I finally got to the good part
What's that? what you are
I must've had half a heart
Cause now my chest feels full 
at least twice as hard
It's like
So loud can anybody else hear it?
Calm down I try to play it cool if I
Knew how can someone keep me grounded?
Before I end up in the clouds with
All of the birds singing
Sweet songs about the way I feel I
Try finding the words but they
Seem small for a really big deal oh I
Don't know what's your deal wherever it is
Promise me you won't stop
I know you just touched down but 3 2
I'm blasting off

Yeah this girl got off a plane ride from Miami

She's a wacky crazy lady
He's a rich rich man
She moved to the state of California
With two kids in hand oh
She's a superstar making money
And she found a boy to call honey
Sunny dumby funny boy
Used him as her little toy
She's got her Beverly Hills boyfriend
Spending all his money
It's okay he's got a lot
Spent a portion on my mom
Beverly Hills boyfriend
He's gone for the weekend
Doesn't care about his bills
Guess that's what life's like in the Hills
She's got funky little quirks
He is always gone at work now
She's living in royalty
Is she living in loyalty?
Now champagne is popping on Sundays
He's away and sipping on Bombay
Wasting bucks on beauty queens
Far away and can't be seen
She's got her Beverly Hills boyfriend
Spending all his money
It's okay he's got a lot
Spent a portion on my mom

985,Supermoon,Summer Salt,"Under the blue light canopy
In between I find it’s clear to me
Over my life you’ve been good to me always
Layover long flight just visiting
In pink rooms and fire flies in window pane
Cat crossing your domain so very glad you came
Never be the same
What a ride round off and fly onto the roof
Fall into iridescent pools
Decorated with talavera tiles
Waterfalls over the castle walls imbue
A supermoon
Over honeydew ripples far away
Gardens of sea life with peonies
THE fair rides at night look like tourmaline
And lemonade stands on a corner by your side
Gas works on hillside in faded jeans
Or dressed in puebla white embroidery
Dragonfly pins in your hair so very glad you came
Never be the same
What a ride round off and fly onto the roof
Fall into iridescent pools
Decorated with talavera tiles
Waterfalls over the castle walls imbue
A supermoon
Over honeydew ripples far away
honeydew ripples far away"

Make me feel fine

Just sipping on that one puff, two drinks

Weight off my mind

That heart a piece of artwork

That body in a t-shirt

My lips speaking these words, aye

Damn baby, damn baby

Damn baby, it's a type of way you make me feel everyday

I'm writing songs 'bout you on the back of a plane

Never been so happy to get back to LA

Thunder and lightning, darling, it's frightening

Best day with ex-lovers worst than us fighting

Like you turned up the brightness

Didn't even know it was dark before

Baby, before I met you, I slept in bedrooms

Got drunk with my friends, gave lots of tattoos

Now I only want you

So sublime, so true

She keep me like a summer cool breeze

Make me feel fine

Just sipping on that one puff, two drinks

Weight off my mind

That heart a piece of artwork

That body in a t-shirt

My lips speaking these words, man

Damn baby, damn baby

Went from ""hello, "" to ""I never wanna say goodbye""

Went from ""what's your name?"" to ""I couldn't forget if I tried""

If I could do it all again, I would do it all again

Just to do it all again and not change a single thing

Baby, before I met you, I slept in bedrooms

Got drunk with my friends, gave lots of tattoos

Now I only want you

So sublime, so true

She keep me like a summer cool breeze

Make me feel fine

Just sipping on that one puff, two drinks

Weight off my mind

That heart a piece of artwork

That body in a t-shirt

When I'm walking the street
Every stranger I meet
I see your face
And I tried to move on but I'm tangled
in memories of you
I want to go out tonight
Get out of my head tonight
But I know it won't do
Cuz there ain't nobody fine enough
No there ain't no drink that's strong enough
No there ain't nobody high that's high enough
To make me forget about you
Forget about you
I still make two cups of coffee
One for you
One for me
Scrolling through every memory
But I don't know how long these pictures will do
I want to go out tonight
Get out of my head tonight
But I know it won't do
Cuz there ain't nobody fine enough
No there ain't no drink that's strong enough
No there ain't nobody high that's high enough
To make me forget about you
Forget about you
Can't forget about you
Can't forget about you
Can't forget about you
No, no there ain't nobody fine enough
There ain't no drink that's strong enough
There ain't nobody high that's high enough

I like to take my time
But time is what you're always chasing

But you're not always keen on seeking
You said you're up for the fight
But I would rather keep on pretending
I feel the divide between
You and I
Like the distance between the dark and light
But just as the dawn is both
Day and night
Maybe I could make you mine
Make you mine
(Make you mine)
Make you mine
(Make you mine)
Make you mine

I know that I have grown jaded
And we could lament over losing
The days of our youth
Memories faded
The years we looked forward
To might be over soon
I feel the divide between
You and I
Like the distance between the dark and light
But just as the dawn is both
Day and night
Maybe I could make you mine

You and I

I'm close

I'm letting you know

Lose myself to someone new
But what if I stay
Would that make me a fool?"

Mixing up these rides

Hear the noise inside

Yes I've been used to being used like this
Ain't no difference
I'm immortalized in my thoughts
Praise to the most high for protection
Over my most prized possessions
Talkin' 'bout my sanity's at a 6 7
Handin' out poinsettias
To my dead homie mothers
Prayin' they feel better
Might get chipped mindin' my business
Might get chipped sharin' my vision
Might as well
Can you tell if it's even worth conversation?
Hit a prayer do it even work?
All that's for real is forever
Moments stolen taste better
I been ridin' ridin' through this cold world
Thought you had another one
Went and caught him with ol' girl
I feel like it's over
Something's callin' you get closer
I'm out of touch
I need a level that's a mile away
Need you once girl once girl
We're goin' out the way
I feel like it's over
Something callin' to get closer
Count my blessings twice as much
Let death stress me too much
Can't hide from pressure
Too worried I'm livin' a lie
Can't trust nobody you ain't been broke with
Niggas love to break my focus bitch
I'm Obi Wan
You caught in the maze I
Thought it'd be easy to get myself
What I needed
But it takes some time
And I'm out of patience I burned it with you
Can't lose myself to your ego I wanna say
Love me better when you try less
I don't take much just need your honesty oh
Love will work better when you confess
Feelings don't need discussion
Spend my life discoverin' new shit
I been ridin' ridin' through this cold world
Thought you had another one
Went and caught him with ol' girl
I feel like it's over
Something's callin' you get closer
I'm out of touch
I need a level that's a mile away
Need you once girl once girl

and you're not there anymore
you're not there anymore
i can't bare bare the thought
that you don't care anymore

now i'm going past your house
don't know how
i ain't seen you yet
wonder what its like when i do
i been through
it all in my head
over and over again
people ask me
if we can ever be friends
over and over and over again
wish they would forget

1011,One More,SG Lewis(에스지 루이스),"I know you can't stay here forever
 I know you've got friends in the bathroom stall
 Been wanna do this since I met you
 Can we just stay here for one more song

 You'll just get distracted and see someone you know
 I'll be waiting getting impatient all alone
 Go out on the balcony, light myself a smoke
 Start talking to someone that I don't even know
 They just might invite me to see another spot
 You'll be trying to find me again but I'll be gone
 We'll forget each other, the night will carry on
 But that don't have to happen
 And that's not what I want, cos

 I know you can't stay here forever
 I know you've got friends in the bathroom stall
 Been wanna do this since I met you
 Can we just stay here for one more song
 If you leave now might forget you
 The memory fades when I'm way too gone
 Was hoping we'd wake up together
 Maybe just stay here for one more song
 Maybe just stay here for one more song

 Now imagine that you stay and we just keep it going
 Just another couple minutes in the vibe we're on
 Then I'll come with you where you're going and we'll both take one
 Feeling rushing over both of us

 So we'll go out on the balcony
 Light ourselves a smoke
 Start talking to people that we don't even know
 Maybe call a taxi, to hit another spot
 But this time you'll be with me, and yeah that's what I want, cos

 I know you can't stay here forever
 I know you got friends in the bathroom stall
 Been wanna do this since I met you
 Can we just stay here for one more song
 If you leave now might forget you
 The Memory fades when I'm way too gone
 Was hoping we'd wake up together
 Maybe just stay here for one more song

 I know you can't stay here forever
 Maybe just stay here for one more song"

그냥 지나가지도
더는 잠을 자지도 못하겠어

나랑 얘기 좀 해 알았어
이 반복 수천 번 했어
달라지는 건 없어
네가 담배를 열 까치 태울 때
내 속이 타들어갔어
위스키로 목을 태울 땐
내 목소린 애가 탔어
돌이킬 수 있을 때가 많았잖아
감정은 메말라가
I don't fx love you
심장에 칼을 꽂은 채로
침대 위에서 밀칠 때
그때 이미 난 모든 게 Fallin down

그런 생각도 못 해봤고
어떻게 오랜 내가 너를 몰라
널 누구보다 잘 알아서
무슨 전활 해야할까
수백번을 고민해봤고
무슨 잠을 자야할까
수천번의 눈을 떠봤어
너와의 정리가 너무나도 아파
이제 아무사이 아니란 것도
우리가 나눴던 모든게 다 잠깐씩
스쳐갈 때마다 괴롭고
너를 만질 수도 없고
안을 수도 없어
깊은 바다에 빠지고 있어
내가 숨쉬고있는 의미를 못찾고
당장의 너가 보고싶어
나는 매 초마다 계속해서 죽어가고있는걸
내가 외롭다가도 계속해서
네가 안아주면 웃었던
그 어디로 흐르는지 모르는
바다에서 나오지도 못하고
얼마 있다가 다시 알겠지
지금 내 옆에 니가 없는걸
매일 널 반복하고 그리면서 살아
아직 벗어나질 못하고
눈에 띄지마라 그럼 난 너를 잡아
나란 사람 얘는 미쳤어
어떤 삶을 살아갈까
니 앞에 기타 부셔버린게 몇갠지
어떤 밤을 살아갈까
매일 매초를 죽여가겠지 너와 난
날 몰아붙이소서
난 여기서부터
화염 속으로
떠 나줘 여기서
사라져 버려줘
니가 날 위해준거라면
매초 마다 나 다시 다짐했는데
매초 마다 널 다시 지웠었는데
매일 밤 너를 그리면서 살아왔는데
이젠 너를 매일 지워가며 죽어가야해
나는 매 초마다 계속해서 죽어가고있는걸
내가 외롭다가도
계속해서 네가 안아주면 웃었던
그 어디로 흐르는지 모르는

When you don't talk to me?
Well how can I breathe with no air?
Well I can only see
What's in front of me
But what's there is more than
What I thought baby
Well in the evening sky
I cast my eye with you on my mind
And if the stars could speak
They'd tell me to sleep
To see you in my dreams
Well in the evening sky
I cast my eye it's a beautiful view
Well I'm lost again with thoughts of you
If only life had more colors I could see
Well life would be balanced
It's hard to conceive it
Well it don't matter
There's a window this evening
Far and wide
You keep texting me
When we're feeling good
Everything's okay
And when we're feeling down
There ain't nothing to say
Well in the evening sky
I cast my eye with you on my mind
And if the stars could speak
They'd tell me to sleep
To see you in my dreams
Well in the evening sky
I cast my eye it's a beautiful view
Well I'm lost again with thoughts of you
If there's reality
Patience please be kind to me
Treat me like you know nothing
As if ain't no history
You can see the pain
See thing from words I speak
And I take it very seriously
Well in the evening sky
I cast my eye with you on my mind
And if the stars could speak
They'd tell me to sleep to see you
In my dreams
Well in the evening sky
I cast my eye it's a beautiful view
Well I'm lost again with thoughts of you

Remember when you used to care
Both your hands still running through my hair
I kissed you
But you left me in a hotel room
Apartment number twenty-two

I'm out my mind
You're on my mind

Sometimes, I still wake up thinking you're by my side
It's like how it was before
Underneath the weight of everything, I'm so tired
It's harder at night 'cause I can still feel you by my side

How can you forget?
We were dancing to ""Pictures of You""
Till you took the air right out the room
I can't see no end
All the messages I never sent
I love you now, I loved you then

I'm out my mind
You're on my mind

Sometimes, I still wake up thinking you're by my side
It's like how it was before
Underneath the weight of everything, I'm so tired
It's harder at night 'cause I can still feel you by my side

Sometimes, I still wake up thinking you're by my side
It's like how it was before
Underneath the weight of everything, I'm so tired
It's harder at night 'cause I can still feel you by my side

잊을 만도 했잖아

전부 사라진 지 오래

너의 환한 미소가

넌 so flowers

붙어있을 만큼 계속 너에게로

넌 so flowers
약간 들리는 소리까지 너에게로
그게 우리의 배경이 될 수 있게

내가 원했던 건 전부 잃었어
I want to be alive

전부 사라진 지 오래
우리가 지냈던 소중한 시간은
Somewhere
매일 밤 불러도 질리지 않던
너의 환한 미소가

행동 하나하나 다
점점 우린 서로 점점
닮아 가는 것 같아
너의 향기에
흠뻑 젖어버려서
비 오는 날 빨래처럼
마르지가 않아
두 눈 맞대고
우리 미랠 의논해
아이는 몇 명이 좋을지
쓸데없는 걱정은
버리기로 해
왜냐면 말 그대로
쓸데없는 걱정이기에
너의 슬픈 모습은
너무나도 보기 싫어
항상 웃어줘
항상 웃어줘
시련이 찾아와도
우린 끄떡없어
Can't stop loving you
너와 똑 닮은 아이를
가지고 싶어
단 하루라도
떨어지기 싫어
넌 나의 영감의
모든 것
인생에서 널 뺀다면
난 돼버려 로봇
세상이 우릴
시험에 들게 해도
상관없어 우린 단단해
누가 뭐래도
흘러 다니는
쓸데없는 말들도
사랑스런 니 앞에선
다 녹아내려
널 만나지 못했더라면
찰나를 놓쳤더라면
가끔 이런 아찔한
생각들을 나도 모르게
널 만나지 못했다면
지금의 나는 없겠지
편지 대신 너에게
이 곡을 바칠게 고마워
시련이 찾아와도
우린 끄떡없어
Can't stop loving you"

Maybe catch a ride in a minute

Since I wrote you a song
Got me feelin' like each day
I can take my pick
We hit the East Bay
It's what I know you'd pick
You got me feelin' secure, like I could pay my rent

알았다가도 또 모른다 하지

Why don't everybody put on glitter eyes
I just wanna see it

빛나는 두 눈으로

버거웠었나
이제는 버리고 가벼워진 생각에 무대로​

등을 돌려버린 그댈 놓지못해요
똑바로 바라봐 줄래요
똑바로 바라봐 나에요
여전히 아름다운지
대답을 원해요 내가 볼품없나요
우리 사랑하긴 했나요
하루종일 시들고있지
먹구름 뿐인 대화 속
따뜻했던 목소리는
겨울이 온듯이 차갑게 식었지
난 무서워 잃어버리는게
외롭게 혼자란게
참 이상해 난 여전히 제자린데 왜
기억해봐요 떠올려봐요
똑바로 바라봐 줄래요
똑바로 바라봐 나에요
여전히 아름다운지
대답을 원해요 내가 볼품없나요
시간이 가면 다 변하는거야
어쩔 수 없는 운명같은
사랑도 같은거야 사람도 그런거야
똑바로 바라봐 줄래요
똑바로 바라봐 나에요
여전히 아름다운지
대답을 원해요 내가 볼품없나요
우리 사랑하긴 했나요"

Left him like an old fling

Troubled waters deep and muddy
Never trust another mother's son
Lookin' back now see what we've become
'Cause I can't really tell what you've been on
Sometimes it's like autopilot
And we can't see eye to eye
Out of sight apologies come too late
Tell me how to act but please it's not your place
Feels like I've been with the wolves all my life
Feels like you've been seein' stars am I right?
I don't need somebody to hold
When it gets cold

I don't need somebody to blame

1093,All I Feel Is Rain (feat. JID),Khalid(칼리드)CONNECT 아티스트,"Although I got love for you
I still can't change your ways
You say you need me the most
Only 'cause I'm here with you
Some things aren't adding up
'Cause your actions stay the same
Why won't you tell me the truth?
If I knew from day one that you wouldn't ride
They say the pain hits you by surprise
You made it sound like you were down
Now you switching sides on me
I know everything
You don't gotta hide from me
I can see it all looking in your eyes
So tell me what I wanna hear
But it's still a lie to me
Never knew you'd be the one
To live a double life on me
All I feel is rain
When you creep out in the night
And you cause me so much pain
But I still stand by your side
I cannot feel a thing
Sometimes I medicate
So I don't feel the rain
When you creep out in the night
And you cause me so much pain
Look uh check
So many good girls
But I tend to love on the trouble type
But I draw a line
If I'm thinking you live a double life
Devil on your left side shoulder
A angel on the right
We right in the middle of arguing at the party
Who started it? Hit the gas
You talkative 'bout to crash
Who parking it? Getting mad
Is your barking at me for saying you heartless?
Trying my hardest to get in harmony
But we harboring feelings
So hovering clouds feeling down
If I knew from day one that you wouldn't ride
They say the pain hits you by surprise
You made it sound like you were down
Now you switching sides on me
I know everything
You don't gotta hide from me
I can see it all looking in your eyes
So tell me what I wanna hear
But it's still a lie to me
Never knew you'd be the one
To live a double life on me
All I feel is rain
When you creep out in the night
And you cause me so much pain
But I still stand by your side
I cannot feel a thing
Sometimes I medicate
So I don't feel the rain
When you creep out in the night

All I feel is rain
I couldn't believe it couldn't believe you no
Look at what you made me do
Tell me you were never there for me"

They are strewn in the city
Daily struggle to be true
Betrayed authenticity

Poison world around but still
I will take another round
Or another ride until
We take off from the ground

Oh, you rich-rich, shoppin' for no reason
You gon' get a new Louis for no reason

You got a lotta places you can go, but
Come with me, come with me

When your heart can't take no more
I've been there before

예 음 Forever young 영원이란 말은 모래성
작별은 마치 재난문자 같지
그리움과 같이 맞이하는 아침
서로가 이 영겁을 지나
꼭 이 섬에서 다시 만나
지나듯 날 위로하던 누구의 말대로 고작
한 뼘짜리 추억을 잊는 게 참 쉽지 않아
시간이 지나도 여전히
날 붙드는 그곳에
우리는 오렌지 태양 아래
그림자 없이 함께 춤을 춰
정해진 안녕 따위는 없어
아름다웠던 그 기억에서 만나
우리는 서로를 베고 누워
슬프지 않은 이야기를 나눠
우울한 결말 따위는 없어
난 영원히 널 이 기억에서 만나

Sorting through recеipts and bygone omens
Of nights I still long for

Forget about the fall
Or can you only love me in the summer
Or never at all?

Oh I know what you did to me last summer
And I don't give a fuck about the fall
But if you only love me in the summer
Did you love me at all?

드넓은 바다에 우리 단둘이서
달콤한 사랑을 속삭일 수도 있어
눈부신 별들이 떠다니는 저 물결을 바라보다

때론 알듯 말듯 헤매이는 네 맘처럼
깊은 강을 헤엄치고파
If you want me to be with you tonight
Feel the sunshine in the sea
If you want me to be with you tonight
Feel the sunshine in the sea
행복함 속에선 항상 두려워져
영원할지 모를 소중한 이 순간

아무에게라도 말해주고 싶은 이 기분

지나쳐가는 사람들의 흥겨운 모습
나를 비웃는 가로등의 고독한 미소
나는 또 뒤돌아 보지만
내게 남아있는 건 그리움

Leather jacket collar popped like antenna,

Sunglasses indoors par for the course, 
lights in the floors and sweat on the walls
Cages and poles
Call off the search for your soul 
or put it on hold again
She's having a sly indoor smoke,
She calls the folks 
who run this her oldest friends,
Sipping her drink and 
laughing at imaginary jokes
As all the signals are sent
Her eyes invite you to approach
And it seems as though 
those lumps in your throat
That you just swallowed have got you going
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Number one party anthem
She's a certified mind blower 
knowing full well that I don't
I may suggest there's somewhere 
from which I might know her
Just to get the ball to roll
Drunken monologues, confused because
It's not like I'm falling in love
I just want you to do me no good
And you look like you could
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Number one party anthem
Come on, come on, come on
Before the moment's gone
Number one party anthem yeah yeah
The look of love 
The rush of blood
The 'she's with me' The Gallic shrug
The shutterbugs The camera plus
The black and white and the colour dodge
The good time girls The cubicles

Just tryna forget, like when will it end? 
Going crazy watching the news 
It’s been the same thing the whole day 
I need you next to me ordering food 
I wouldn’t have it any other way 
I’d rather be bored 
Bored doing nothing with you 
I’d rather be up in my bed 
Watching some Netflix 
Girl if there’s nothing to do 
I’d rather be bored 
Bored doing nothing with you 
I’d rather be up in my bed 
Watching some Netflix 
Girl if there’s nothing to do 
I’ma do it with you
I’ma do it with you"

When I finally lay my eyes on you?
Someone I've already loved
Or will you find your way out of the blue?
Will it be my flat or your apartment
When I finally realise I do?
Will we meet on Baker Street
Or find ourselves on Melrose Avenue?
I don't know who you are
But I'll save you a seat
Hang my coat on a chair next to me
I tried to reassure the waiter
Say you're down the street
He laughed at me
So here's to you
The most beautiful thing 
that I have never seen
Someone on a screen asked me a question
Something about what love means to me
Maybe it's just circumstance
Or general compatibility
I don't know who you are
But I'll save you a seat

Maybe you'll loose the one so dear

You are the one to bring me back to earth
See you remind where I came from
So when you're done with work
Just hit me boy I'll slide
Mediate on you just for the high

I won't worry

To be together
Just you and me

Keeping up with Joneses

Take my hand
We can slow dance don't need music
And talk like it's our first date
What a beautiful life we've made
I wouldn't change a thang
Our love has grown
But it would be
A mistake
If we didn't take a while
To stop and smile
And remember how it all started
Call me naive
A hopeless romantic
But I still think you're fine
Before the bills the car
the house and the baby
Sugar you were all mine all mine
Take my hand
And we could revisit the place
Where we shared our first kiss
What a beautiful life we've made
I wouldn't change a thang
Our love has grown
But it would be
A mistake
If we didn't take a while
To stop and smile
And remember how it all started
Through the years
We have made so many memories
And I am still madly in love 3000
Way past the honeymoon but
Don't care that we've grown up
You make our love feel brand new
What a beautiful life we've made
I wouldn't change a thang
Our love has grown
But it would be

영원이라 믿었지
너는 사랑을 봤니
두 눈으로 선명히 말야
보이지도 않는데 대체 왜
사랑을 믿는 거니
사라지는 것은 하나같이 변명이 많아
사실 난 이유 따윈 중요하지 않은데
지키지 못한 건 하나같이 미련이 남아
지나친 추억들은 결국 우리 것이 아닌데
아 아아 아 우리는
아 아아 아 사랑을
아 아아 아 안고서
또 반복되겠지
너는 사랑을 믿니
그래 그 불완전한 것 말야
돌아갈 수도 없는 순간을
우리는 믿은 거야"

마지막 잎새는 떨어지겠지만
나의 진심을 전할 수가 없어요

잊어줄래요 나만 아프면 돼요

종소리와 함께 잠에 들겠죠
가난하고 서투른 내 사랑
드릴 수 있는 건 이 노래뿐이야

Oh girl
I really don't know how to say this
But I think I have to let you go
I know
But I think it's the best
It's the best for the both of us
I'm sorry
사랑하지 않는게 아냐
그럴 수가 없는 거야
이렇게 떠나는 날
더 이상 초라하게 하지마
너도 알잖아
마음뿐인 사랑에
행복이라는 건 없다는걸
더는 널 울리고 싶지 않아
더 이상 울리고 싶지 않아
So now this is goodbye
Goodbye
원망하고 저주해요 날
그래야 내가 맘 편히

'Cause all you say are all the same things I did
Copycat trying to cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat trying to cop my glamour
Why so sad bunny you can't have mine?
Call me calloused call me cold
You're italic I'm in bold
Call me cocky watch your tone
You better love me 'cause you're just a clone
By the way you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did
Copycat trying to cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat trying to cop my glamor
Why so sad bunny you can't have mine?
I would hate to see you go
Hate to be the one that told you so
You just crossed the line
You've run out of time
I'm so sorry now you know
Sorry I'm the one that told you so
Sorry sorry I'm sorry sorry
Psych
By the way you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did
Copycat trying to cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat trying to cop my glamour
Why so sad bunny you can't have mine?"
1213,Over,CHVRCHES(처치스),"Sometimes I just drive
Till the night turns off my mind
I'm passing cars
And crowded bars
Never know until I go too far
Confusing faith and fear
Paint a smile from ear to ear
'Cause if I blink
I start to think
I feel nothing I feel everything
I try my best to turn down the noise
And I tell myself that boys will be boys
It's getting harder to breathe
So baby put me to sleep
Till it gets better
So wake me up when it's over
It's over
When it's over
Tell me it was all just a dream
And wake me up when it's over
It's over
When it's over
Tell me it was all just a dream
And I'll believe it
Keep me in the dark
Then fast forward to the part
With endless nights
And neon lights
I'll be beautiful and starry eyed
I try my best to turn down the noise
And I tell myself that boys will be boys
It's getting harder to breathe
So baby put me to sleep
Till it gets better
So wake me up when it's over
It's over
When it's over
Tell me it was all just a dream
And wake me up when it's over
It's over
When it's over
Tell me it was all just a dream
And I'll believe it
Sometimes I just drive
When I can't turn off my mind
I don't know where
I'll meet you there
Someday
So wake me up when it's over
It's over
When it's over
Tell me it was all just a dream
And wake me up when it's over
It's over
When it's over
Tell me it was all just a dream
And I'll believe it"
1214,Everything I Know About Love,Laufey,"So enchanting in every way
It's everlasting every day
Sweet obsession, rose bouquets
Oh, it's heaven or so they say

I wouldn't mind
I heard that falling fast is so divine
Are these songs just telling plain old lies?
Cause that's everything I know about love
Everything I know about love

I don't know that much at all
I trip, I fall
Every time I try it's all too much
That's everything I know about love

Captivating angel eyes
Stomach sick with butterflies
When will someone prove to me
That this isn't fantasy

Cause I wouldn't mind
I heard that falling fast is so divine
Are these songs just telling plain old lies?
Cause that's everything I know about love
That's everything I know about love

Oh, I don't know that much at all
I trip, I fall
Every time I try it's all too much
That's everything I know about love

Oh, I don't know that much at all
I trip, I fall
Every time I try it's all too much
That's everything I know about love"
1215,Before You Go,Lewis Capaldi,"I fell by the wayside like everyone else
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you
but I was just kidding myself
Our every moment, I start to replace
'Cause now that they're gone,
all I hear are the words that I needed to say
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal but this won't
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind
can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go
Was never the right time,
whenever you called
Went little by little by little
until there was nothing at all
Our every moment, I start to replay
But all I can think about
is seeing that look on your face
When you hurt under the surface
Like troubled water running cold
Well, time can heal but this won't
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind
can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go
Would we be better off by now
If I'd have let my walls come down?
Maybe, I guess we'll never know
You know, you know
Before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make your heart beat better?
If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather
So, before you go
Was there something I could've said
To make it all stop hurting?
It kills me how your mind
can make you feel so worthless
So, before you go"
1216,Be Right There,Fly By Midnight,"Waking up feeling upside down
Like a queen, but you got no crown
Yeah, it's cloudy on a Saturday, oh, I
Wanna know what's on your mind
Tell me why your sun don't shine, yeah
Just slow it down and say to me
You need someone to lean on
And turn the grey to neon
It's cold, let's turn the heat on tonight
Why don't me and you take some blue?
Throw it at the sky
Life is short but sweet, fuck a piece
Take the whole damn pie
If you call, I'm coming
Late night or morning
I'ma be right there, be right there
Every time
Why don't me and you take some blue?
Throw it at the sky
Life is short but sweet, fuck a piece
Take the whole damn pie
If you call, I'm coming
Late night or morning
I'ma be right there, be right there
Every time
Wanna take all the pain (that's weighing on you)
We could strip it away (like clothes come off you)
Yeah, it's been awhile, you're overdue, so look
To your left, to your right (tell me what you see)
Like the Bill Withers line (you can lean on me, lean on me)
Just turn it up and sing to me
You need someone to lean on
And turn the grey to neon
It's cold, let's turn the heat on tonight
Why don't me and you take some blue?
Throw it at the sky
Life is short but sweet, fuck a piece
Take the whole damn pie
If you call, I'm coming
Late night or morning
I'ma be right there, be right there
Every time
Why don't me and you take some blue?
Throw it at the sky
Life is short but sweet, fuck a piece
Take the whole damn pie
If you call, I'm coming
Late night or morning
I'ma be right there, be right there
Every time
What's up? What's on your mind?
I know it's hard sometimes
If it helps just a little
I could stay for a little while
You been, been on my mind
I know it's hard sometimes
If it helps just a little
I could stay for a little while"
1220,Paris III,Oracle Sisters,"Oh my love
Oh my love
Distance to dust
Two way song
Two way song
Simple, sincere

Whatever makes you happy
Whatever makes you sad
Whatever makes you happy
Is a part of you

Oh my love
Oh my love
Distance to dust
Two way song
Two way song

1222,Sticks & Stones,Nieman,"Maybe I was confused
Thinking that there was more
I would have to lose
Maybe I was afraid
Letting go of all
Tied to one place
I confess, I was a bit selfish
Protective of our space
I guess maybe I just expected
This to go away
A house is only sticks and stones
That's what I've come to know
Some on the go
Find peace out on the road
But that don't mean that they're alone
As we reside
On borrowed time
The truth I'll hold
Was always you that made it home
You're what made it home
Maybe I always knew
That there would come a day
We'd have to start anew
I thought if I kept it out of mind
I'd never have to say goodbye
Like out of sight
Would make it easy to leave behind
I confess, I felt a bit helpless
Like it was my problem to save
In hindsight, I guess I rejected
Things would have to change
A house is only sticks and stones
That's what I've come to know
Some on the go
Find peace out on the road
But that don't mean that they're alone
As we reside
On borrowed time
The truth I'll hold
Was always you that made it home
What we have written in memory
Doesn't belong to any street
I'll keep it safe with me
Forever it holds a residence
Cul-de-sac home inside my head
That's how it'll be for me
Cuz now I see that
A house is only sticks and stones
That's what I've come to know
Some on the go
Find peace out on the road
But that don't mean that they're alone
As we reside
On borrowed time
The truth I'll hold
Was always you that made it home
You're what made it home home
You're what made it home
Maybe what they say is true
There really are some things
You're never gonna lose"

1224,Heavenly Kind Of State Of Mind,Lewis Capaldi,"It's almost cruel, the blue in your eyes
The kind of blasphemy that makes a congregation cry
When I'm with you, it's like nothing else
Like I could run and tell the devil to go fuck himself

Oh Lord, I ain't afraid to die
If it means I'm by your side
It would be such a heavenly way to say goodbye
From now until the afterlife
Be it rain or hail or shine
We could be intertwined

Whether you were heaven-sent to save me from above
Or the only one who doesn't hate me, that's enough
When I need someone to save me from original sin
You call me like a chorus only angels could sing
Now, I think about you all of the time
Oh, what a heavenly kind of state of mind

You bring me peace that I'd never find
There's only chaos when I'm left here to my own device
To tell the truth, I think you saved my life
Giving my heart over to you would be no sacrifice

Oh Lord, I ain't afraid to die
If it means I'm by your side
It would be such a heavenly way to say goodbye
From now until the afterlife
Be it rain or hail or shine
We could be intertwined

Whether you were heaven-sent to save me from above
Or the only one who doesn't hate me, that's enough
When I need someone to save me from original sin
You call me like a chorus, only angels could sing
Now, I think about you all of the time
Oh, what a heavenly kind of state of mind

And I feel the rapture
When I'm looking at ya
Oh, what a heavenly kind of state of mind
You're the only reason
That I keep believing
Oh, what a heavenly kind

Darling, you were heaven-sent to save me from above
You're the only one who doesn't hate me, that's enough
When I need someone to save me from original sin
You call me like a chorus, only angels could sing
Now, I think about you all of the time
Oh, what a heavenly kind of state of mind

And I feel the rapture
When I'm looking at ya
Oh, what a heavenly kind of state of mind
You're the only reason

1225,Don't Say That,Ricky Montgomery,"Don't say that 

Don't be sad 

I didn't think someone could be so bad 

I mean it don't say that 

Don't be sad 

I didn't think people could be this bad 

I see the moon 

In the violet sky 

And it looks so pretty 

I just might cry 

I sit alone 

In the candlelight 

Because i didn't get the job 

For which i tried and tried 

You know its so, so scary 

When you see me for who i really am 

You know its so, so scary

Ah da da da ooo 

It's alright 

Ooooooooo 

You do yours and I'll do mine 

I'm in the pool 

In the pouring rain 

I stick my tongue into the tip of the daisy chain 

I took your phone 

In a drunken state 

I think it's funny 
when you're too annoyed to concentrate  

You know it's so, so scary 

When you see me for what I truly am 

You know its so, so scary 

When you look right at me 
in my eyes and you say

I'm about to say somethin' alright

Nobody needs you

Nobody hurts you

Who are you really kiddin'?
Hey are you really livin'?
The older you get
The deeper you feel it
Pretend to be brave
And cover your feelings
But they lose their place
And you let all the fear end
And slowly erase
That beautiful dreamin'
Forget where you came from
And how far you're going
Forget how to play fun
The more that you're growing
And if you never give up then
All will be well
But you gotta fight for it
You really gotta try for it
'Cause nobody knows you
Like you know yourself
Nobody needs you
Like you need yourself
Nobody hurts you
Like you hurt yourself

1230,backseat driving,joan,"Past life, I'm thinking 'bout a past life
Good times, we used to have some good times

[Pre-Chorus]
Should we just start over?
Should we hit the brakes?

[Chorus]
You got me swerving between the lanes
And now I'm closing my eyes and accelerating
Oh, there's only so much I can take with all this
Backseat driving



[Verse 2]
Crossfire, we're caught up in the crossfire
Cloudy skies, got me thinking 'bout the last time

[Pre-Chorus]
We said we should start over
Instead of hitting the brakes

[Chorus]
You got me swеrving between the lanes
And now I'm closing my еyes and accelerating
Oh, there's only so much I can take with all this
Backseat driving
We're breaking down and this car is crashed
And we were ignoring all the signs we passed
And now there's no way that we can turn back with all this
Backseat driving

[Bridge]
Got me turning the wrong way
Over the bridge in the lake
Feels like you are miles away
With all this backseat driving
Breaking down and car is crashed
Ignored all the signs we've passed
Now there's no way we'll go back
With all this backseat driving


[Chorus]
You got me swerving between the lanes
And now I'm closing my eyes and accelerating
Oh, there's only so much I can take with all this
Backseat driving
We're breaking down and this car is crashed
And we were ignoring all the signs we passed
And now there's no way that we can turn back with all this

Got me turning the wrong way
Over the bridge in the lake (turning the wrong way)
Feels like you are miles away

1231,Thorns,Yum Yuck,"My days are always strange
They change faces and slip away
But I don't mind no I don't mind
Cause the night can still be kind
Another close shave with a dull blade
Yeah she really likes to see my face
So I take time and I take pride
I keep the razor by my side
She only comes out when it's raining
She's always hiding the pain away
It's just her way
My heart could clot
If you choke it up enough
And don't despair all the rituals and fanfare
My sunken thoughts my cabin built from thorns
The moon is high but the river's running dry
She only comes out when it's raining
She's always hiding the pain away
It's just her way
But don't you weep or turn the other cheek
Just think of me when you look outside
and it's raining"
1233,Rather Be Happy (feat. hazel),Braaten,"Looking at the pictures of us from before
Doing all the things we don't do anymore
Though we both made mistakes
Seems like I am the one who pays
You used to feel like home
Staying up for hours
Always wanting more
Now instead of crying from laughing too much
The tears in my eyes are there because
Cause I remember you would shiver
When I called your name
And every inch of me was so in love
How did we change
So I'd do anything to make you want me
Now I see
I'd rather be happy
Ra-ra-ra, Ra-ra-ra
Rather be happy
Ra-ra-ra, Ra-ra-ra
Rather be happy
Ra-ra-ra, Ra-ra-ra
Rather be happy
I'd rather be happy
Ra-ra-ra, Ra-ra-ra
Rather be happy
I don't wanna leave
Don't wanna walk away
Cause when I picture you with someone else
My heart breaks
I wish I could stay
But we ran out of things to say
Oh, yeah
When I'm waking up beside
It's like you're not there
And when we kissing
Oh, I'm missing how it used to taste
And it hurts so much to look at all we lost
Tell me how did we get here
Cause I remember you would shiver
When I called your name
And every inch of me was so in love
How did we change
So I'd do anything to make you want me
Now I see
I'd rather be happy

1234,A Song About Me,Oscar Lang,"Well I tried
I swear to God I really tried
Well you cried
But I'd seen it from before behind your eyes
Now you ask me how am I feeling
Now I feel cut in half
I've become another person
Now it hurts when I laugh
'Cause it reminds me of your personality
Guess that I lied when I agreed
You said 'don't you write a song about me'
Well I know
Know you're listening now
And you're feeling sad
Well I hope
Yeah I hope one day
We can laugh about the past
You asked me how am I feeling
Now I feel cut in half
I've become another person
Now it hurts when I laugh
'Cause it reminds me of your personality
I guess that I lied when I agreed
You said 'don't you write a song about me'
This is a song to always remind me
Now I'm moving on
Now I'm moving on
We built up the walls
Then watch as they fall down
Now I'm moving on now
Now I'm moving on now
Now I'm moving on now
Now I'm moving on now

I'm a tidal wave of question marks
And you're just surfing

Lately you just understand my feelings
Make me see I'm capable and fine
And feeling beautified
Tonight I'm ready to dive
Maybe it's the loving in your eyes
(I'm here see through)
Maybe it's the magic in the wine
(I'm feeling loose)
Maybe it's the fact that every time I fall
I lose it all
But you got me from my head to my feet
And I'm ready to dive
'Cause the water's warm
And nothing is wrong it's all right
I'm coming out and diving in tonight
I feel like it's crazy
Lately you just understand my feelings

Wanna swim good and I wanna swim deep
I'm diving into you diving into me
Wanna swim good and I wanna swim deep
I'm diving into you diving into me
Wanna swim good and I wanna swim deep

I hope it flies your way
that it don't crash and break
before it gets to you

lost the ability to speak

ever since the day in the park when we talked
I’ve kept on thinking about what we could be
dream about a late night
red sky
your hand
in mine
oh
don’t know if you think about me
think think about
I'mma send a paper plane
I hope it flies your way
that it don't crash and break
before it gets to you
right now I’m too shy to say
what I have felt for days
it’s easier this way
I hope it gets to you

damn it feels like i’m back in school
(a million butterflies)
why can’t I just walk up to you
(it’s like I’m paralyzed)
cause I’ve been staying up late every night
thinking‘bout it
is it just me or do you feel it too
dream about a late night
red sky
your hand
in mine

I'll follow you until it's done
I'll follow you
I'll follow you until the sun
I'll follow you until it's done
I'll follow you until the sun
I'll follow you until it's done
I'll follow you"
