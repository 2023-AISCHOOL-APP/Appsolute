0,A Ok,Ola Village,"Haven't left this room in thirty days
The things I know now it's amazing
I've learned I have this thing called brain
Don't understand why I've escaped it for so long
We've just begun let's get to know each other
Like no one other
Have some fun
Forget everyone we don't wanna talk to
Don't wanna talk to you

Everything is A OK
Yeah, everything is OK
Everything is A OK

Haven't left this room in thirty days
The things I dream now, it is crazy
Me and Kanye West made lemonade
Got a little bit sad and then we cried for a while
But it was fun
Lemons in the sunlight
And the world was so quiet
Even though it was this once, this one time
I might be happy for the rest of my life


Everything is A OK
Yeah, everything is OK
Everything is A OK

Haven't left this room in thirty days
The things I know now it's amazing
I've learned I have this thing called brain
Brain, brain, brain, brain
Don't understand why I've escaped it

Everything is A OK
Yeah, everything is OK
Everything is A OK

Everything is A OK
Yeah, everything is OK
Everything is A OK"
2,"sunkissed (feat. pluto, lovemark)",NVTHVN,"You and I we're like fire and ice now
Face to face and I'm all jello slush wow
You have changed my whole world in an instant
Made me love all the parts that I didn't
And I wanted to tell you
that I may look away but
Don't get me wrong I really like your face 'cause
When we meet lips it's our sun kiss
Being with you so clearly dries up all the rain
Used to be so far from free
But when we're like this my darling
It's like sunshine all day
Didn't you feel the sun?
Sorry girl please forgive me if I stare
When I'm with you I lose all of my cares
Can you blame me you glow like the sunrise
Fall in love every time I look in your eyes
I'll try to be something wonderful to you
But with the way that you are
There's nothing I wouldn't do cause
When we meet lips it's our sun kiss
Being with you so clearly dries up all the rain
Used to be so far from free
But when we're like this my darling
It's like sunshine all day
And I'm not saying that I love you
But I know that I'm liking the view
If we take it slow we can intertwine
And make it bright like sunshine
When we meet lips it's our sun kiss
Being with you so clearly dries up all the rain
Used to be so far from free
But when we're like this my darling
It's like sunshine all day
How do you see right through?
And I know that you love me
when you look into my eyes
Don't need time cause you're all mine
And I hope that you want me
for the rest of your life
Oh oh oh oh
It's like sunshine all day"
3,Loving You Crazy,Josh Tobias(조쉬 토비아스),"I know you worry 'bout me baby
Feels like you want to worry me away
But I've gotten a stubborn heart
That would fall apart
The moment that
You walked away from me
Might say that I'm alright but ya
Don't know what
You're putting me through
Might as well tell the truth
It's something I need
Cuz' your love is amazing
I'm down on my knees
Darlin please save me
I'm willing to bleed
If it means that you'll stay with me
Cuz honestly I
I'm loving you crazy
I know you wish it could be simple
But love can be a complicated thing
Cuz I've got a restless mind
And I waste my time
Going 'round in circles in my dreams
Might say that im ok but you
Don't know what you mean to me
Baby can't you see
It's something I need
Cuz' your love is amazing
I'm down on my knees
Darlin please save me
I'm willing to bleed
If it means that you'll stay with me
Cuz honestly I
I'm loving you crazy
Just a little longer baby
This love is getting stronger baby
Can't tell you how long
I've been waiting for you
It's something I need
Cuz' your love is amazing
I'm down on my knees
Darlin please save me
I'm willing to bleed
If it means that you'll stay with me

I'm loving you crazy"
4,cereals and milk,Oscar Anton,"Man's down you go
On a sunday afternoon
I owe you so
It's been fun but now I'm sure
There's no place for me
In these dreams or in between
Not now supposedly
Don't wake me up if you're leaving
Don't hesitate if you think
That cereals and milk won't change a thing
It makes sense to me
Don't wake me up if you're leaving
Don't hesitate if you think
That cereals and milk won't change a thing
It makes sense to me
Man's down you go On a sunday afternoon
I owe you so
It's all fun until you lose
It's so easy to be
Even slightly interested Once we fall asleep
I'm not used to it
But my heart is listening So next time
I doubt I will
Don't wake me up if you're leaving
Don't hesitate if you think
That cereals and milk won't change a thing
It makes sense to me
Don't wake me up if you're leaving
Don't hesitate if you think
That cereals and milk won't change a thing
It makes sense to me
Don't wake me up if you're leaving
Don't hesitate if you think
That cereals and milk won't change a thing

7,LA Love,Transviolet(트랜스바이올렛),"Light explodes on diamonds painting prisms, 
spilling rainbows on the floor
Gold martini goddess sips on vodka 
while white collars stalk the girls,
And the big suits buy their
LA Love, burns like the summer sun
Only love you when you're someone
Only love you when you're someone
LA Love, hot like a loaded gun
Only love you when you're someone
Only love you when you're someone

Lounges buzz electric, 
low lit taverns sit back classy thick with smoke
Bar flies make impressions, hunt connections,
Laughing loud at dated jokes
Don't they all want that

Only love you when you're someone
Only love you when you're someone

8,Softly,Clairo,"Is it alright to feel this way so early?
And in my blood
All the sweet nothings
Fallin' in love overnight
Didn't mean to get so close
And I know that I should probably go
But I got this feeling
Tell me girl I gotta know
Touch you softly
I call you up late at night
Know that it isn't right
But you could be my one and only
You get me in the mood
Know what I'm tryna do
Do you think that
We can move closer baby?
I want you yeah yeah
All my life been wanting this forever (Mmm)
And in my mind think of ways to ask you
Why don't you come over sometime?

11,Bad (Acoustic),Lennon Stella(레논 스텔라),"All the little gifts you gave
I call it overcompensating
Feeling just like a princess
Every answer was always yes
You had me living in a dream
Was forever long to you? 
Did you say that to her too?
Making sure that I’d never know
Callin' her while the shower goes
Then crawl back in bed, it's a shame

I probably should’ve known better
I probably should’ve known better
Every word you said
Yeah, you was sweet, but you was lying
Everything you covered up
Making up, just to keep me from crying

I wish that you woulda treated me bad
The truth is, you couldn’t have loved me better
Now I’m left feeling twice as sad
I wish you woulda treated me bad, bad, bad
I wish that you woulda treated me bad
Truth is, you couldn’t have loved me better
Now I’m left feeling twice as sad
I wish you woulda treated me bad, bad, bad

I wasn’t catching on to you 
Blinded by your lips, so smooth 
Excusing all of your 'gotta go's'
Leaving me to be all alone
Then you took my heart just the same

I probably should’ve known better
I probably should’ve known better
Every word you said, yeah, you was sweet, but you was lying
Everything you covered up, making up, just to keep me from crying

I wish that you woulda treated me bad

Tell me the truth
Was it worth it? Was I worth it for you?
'Cause we were perfect, we working 'til you
Forgot to tell me you been seeing someone else for six years

I wish that you woulda treated me bad

15,Summer Rain,Josh Tobias(조쉬 토비아스),"In your arms
Is where I wanna be when the sun goes down
And our home seems so far
But driving down the interstate
Wind blowing in our face
Makes me realize
That in your eyes
I find my inner piece
I don't wanna wait until the storms rolls away
Cuz I wanna kiss you in the summer rain
You are the song I was born to sing
I'll sing it loud
I wanna remember every word you say
Don't wanna believe that love fades away
Now everytime a storm rolls our way
I think about us babe
Getting caught in the summer rain
Ooh getting caught in the summer rain
I know I can do things
That give you a migraine
Baby please believe
That it's only love
Took a little while to
Let the sun peak through
But after all these years
I finally realize
Come rain or shine
Our love will find a way
I don't wanna wait until the storms rolls away
Cuz I wanna kiss you in the summer rain
You are the song I was born to sing
I'll sing it loud
I wanna remember every word you say
Don't wanna believe that love fades away
Now everytime a storm rolls our way
I think about us babe
Getting caught in the summer rain
Ooh getting caught in the summer rain
Ooh
She my little baby always gonna be
Plenty other babies but she's all that I see
When we're lying all alone in the morning
Yah it dawns on me
Yah it dawns on me
I realize
Come rain or shine
Our love will find a way
I don't wanna wait until the storms rolls away
Cuz I wanna kiss you in the summer rain
You are the song I was born to sing
I'll sing it loud
I wanna remember every word you say
Don't wanna believe that love fades away
Now everytime a storm rolls our way

17,If you,heyden,"I used to be a loner in the backseat
Looking at my phone like I'm not listening
Ain't nobody call me on my phone
Nobody is gonna knocking on my door
You used to be a good girl in the backseat
Everybody loves you 'cause you're pretty
She's got lotta friends around her too
I can't even come close to her no
Where can I see your world 'cause I need
Something that holds me
I know we all get lonely
If you are falling I'll be here for you
Like you did for me when I was lonely
I used to be a loner in the backseat
Looking at my phone like I'm not listening
Ain't nobody call me on my phone
Nobody is gonna knocking on my door

If you are falling I'll be here for you
Like you did for me when I was lonely
When I was lonely
If you didn't save me
Would've ran away from it
As long as you are here with me
Tried to find the best of me
And I'm glad you dragged me
Out of this dark for me
This one is just for you
I used to be a loner in the backseat
Looking at my phone like I'm not listening
Ain't nobody call me on my phone
Nobody is gonna knocking on my door
You used to be a good girl in the backseat

And if we cross paths, we can look the other way?
I wear short sleeves, I learned the hard way
That you should keep your heart locked up in a safe
Is it too much to think that we could move on
Go all the way around to the start of it all
When you were just you and I was just me?
Don't wanna go back to the shit in between

[Pre-Chorus]
But since we're standing face to face
There's nothing left to say but

[Chorus]
It's good to see you again
The very same mouth on the very same head
That told me in a hundred years when we're both dead
You would still never wanna see me again
So thank God we're with all of our friends
'Cause I'd hate to have to deal with all the shit that we said
'Cause you could say ""I'm sorry"" in English, Spanish, and French
Still, I'd never wanna see you again

Without causing a scene or getting into a fight?
I wasn't prepared to look into your eyes
The same brown circles that told me all those lies, no

Let me show you the way to cities you would never go
한번도 가보지 못한 곳으로 당신을 데려갈게요"
77,Younger (R&B Mix),Jonas Blue(조나스 블루),"Someday we'll be a million miles away
Waking up on monday morning
Wishing it was saturday
Kids screaming out no warning
This will be a distant memory
I can hear the future calling let it wait
'Cause you know that we got time
To get ourselves together
We got time for us
Someday let's waste our time like
We'll be young forever
Stay forever young
When we were seventeen
Feels like just yesterday
Living a lucid dream
Those years just fall away
One day we'll be 33 before
We're old and gray
Let's still be seventeen like yesterday
Let's stay younger together
Let's stay younger together
Let's stay younger together
Let's stay younger together
Let's stay younger together
Let's stay younger together
Let's stay younger together
Let's stay younger together
Let's stay younger together
Let's stay younger together
Let's stay younger together
Let's stay younger together
Let's stay younger together
Always you'll always be my fantasy
Even when we're grown up
Know that I love you better than today
One day we'll be dancing slowly
But for now I'll make it rain
I can see the future calling anyway
'Cause you know that we got time
To get ourselves together
We got time for us
Someday let's waste our time
Like we'll be young forever
Stay forever young
When we were seventeen
Feels like just yesterday

78,Is It Her?,Video AgeCONNECT 아티스트,"How can I be so far from you
When all I see is how happy we could be?
I know a way
I'll hear you call me
It's not too late
I've never been so sure
It's her
Is it her?
Is it her?
Why won't you stay?
Now all I have is that note you gave
The one I'll always save
If not today
We'll share the same dream
From far away
Knocking at my door
From her
Is it her?
Is it her?
How could I mistrust you?
How could I pretend?
That missing you would ever end
You and I both know
Stranger things have happened
A stranger's often closer than the ones you know
Is it her?
Is it her? How can I"
79,The Simple Things,Michael Carreon(마이클 캐리언),"It’s the simple things you do
I just can’t get enough of you
It’s that perfume that you wear and 
The way you do your hair 
That I love so much
And it’s the simple things you say
And how in bed we play
It’s the way you kiss my cheek 
when you think
That I’m asleep
I love it so much

I love you words 
I never say friends make fun 
but I tell you every day anyway 
lately you been getting me home safely 
Wake up love the coffee that you make 
Ask me how my night was 
I like us its so easy 
and we don’t ever fight 
cause you don’t blow up 
my phone when your home alone
Assuming that I’m doing what a guy does
Trust with just the right amount of lust
Even loved by my family that a must 
and fun everything we do me and you
My song comes on 
and you dance n sing too 
with the windows down like Gs 
we don’t care who’s around or who sees
And everyone is jealous of my ride 
because you sitting in the passenger side 

It’s the simple things you do
I just can’t get enough of you
It’s that perfume that you wear and 
The way you do your hair 
That I love so much
And it’s the simple things you say
And how in bed we play
It’s the way you kiss my cheek 
when you think
That I’m asleep
I love it so much

Everyday scrubbing 
it loving it cruising freeways 
in our PJs cause that’s the fun of it unless 
You wear that pretty black dress O yes
Catch me in a suit so 
I can look as good as you but I don’t
O well with a that smile 
that you wear so well 
And the way that you cry 
in movies pass you the ball 
and you pass it back to me

Beer s with the guys aint no thing 
it’s your eyes and the simple things
That make this work like it should 
when you rock my shirt o you look so good 
So take my hand stay 
as long as you can with the man
That tells all the jokes only you understand 
and I promise to be honest 
if you promise to accomplish love 
all we need is love"

I know that you're worth it
I really love when it's earned
It seems like you want this
And when it's done to the dirt
Who could regret this?
I fell in love with your word
It seems like you're worth it

I wanna make it good if it kills me
You have to be hurt, to ever feel good
I wanna make it work
I wanna make it good 'til tomorrow
You have to be hurt, to ever feel good

I'm learning to take it slow but I don't wanna though
Especially tonight you look 
phenomenal, simply astronomical
I had a moment where I zoned 
and thought of us alone
I had you moaning, yeah, I wanna jump your bones
But it takes more than a boner 
for us to make a happy home
But when I grow up big and strong, 
I sure don't wanna live alone
So fuck the phone, I cross the ocean in a boat
I have to row cause flowing's too slow
And both motors are broken
And the sky opens up and I don't have a raincoat
Cause I threw everything 
I own out for this hand-written note
That says ""I wanna make it work"", 
that might not even work
Cause do I really believe that two people 
on this Earth are meant to be?
Eventually, I guess we'll see 
but in the meantime let's roll this weed
Turn out free time to you and me time
Turn our free time to you and me time
Let's turn our free time to, you know

Every time (every time)
We settled but it never felt right
'Cause we can't keep still
And we try to fight the way everything feels
When we step out of line
I met your gaze and it was love
That we were makin' it
And she spoke a different language
There was no need for translation
And I ordered chicken fingers to my room, girl

You called me for whatever feels right
Baby, don't stay still, make your mind
You could be wakin' up in here
For the rest of your life
And I knew just what she was thinkin'
With no need for speculation
Just your body and a blanket
And I hope this doesn't change it
'Cause the best part of my day is
When I get to see you naked

On the way you used to smile at me
I used to write them for you daily
But my thumbs are running dry lately
No one wants to hear a song
About the bitch that broke my heart
I should have listened to my mama
She saw through you from the start

But now we're here in Regent's Park
Amongst the flowers and I wish it would rain
'Cause in the sun, you look so lovely
That I'm falling for you over again
Since I have nothing left to say
That will make you change your mind
I'll say goodbye on a beautiful spring day

It was a place not too dissimilar to this one
Where I first saw your face
You look like home, sat all alone
I should have found somebody cheaper to chase
Tragically, nobody told me
How expensive you would be
I lost more than money, dear
You knocked the swagger out of me

But now we're here in Regent's Park
Amongst the flowers and I wish it would rain
'Cause in the sun, you look so lovely

Tired of running from it
Scared of feeling something

I tried to make it work but I've been feeling so numb

Skies are bleeding on me
Why'd you leave me lonely?
Feeling Whitney Stoney
Now I'm stuck and wonder where I ever went wrong
How could I be strong
I'm fighting for your love

I can't wait for you
To come my way
I've been far away
But I'll keep runnin'
Just to find a way to you 'til then

I don't see light in your love anymore
There ain't no reason in pourin' a four
I don't like feelings or feeling like running from something
And feeling so out of control
I know that the feeling is gone
I'm spending too much time alone
I'm hopin' you pick up the phone

And ring me when you wanna stay overnight
My shoulders right, my baby is all that I want
I'll play them all of my favorite songs
That lady is my favorite one

I can't wait for you
To come my way
I've been far away
But I'll keep runnin'
Just to find a way to you 'til then

Ain't never gonna let ya go
Got my heart Nascar racing
Shine ain't ever fading
He just left ya hangin'
Fiendin' for ya love
All worth it for the waiting

Give you what you need
Take you where he won't
Can feel it when we're all alone
Know you're wanting something more
My heart is like an open door
Just ring me when you wanna go

I'll wait
'Til you're home
Hold a place 'til you're comin home
Show you where the garden grows
Just ring me when you wanna go

Pretend it all is just the same
Hard to tell when you're in it

And I know it's cool
Yeah it's alright
To play this charade
For just one night
But when the time comes
Could we take it back to wherever it started from
Could we take it back to wherever it started from

If we only let it
Would it all fade away
Might we just forget it
If we don't choose to make it stay
And I know this hazy in between
Is like a confused and lucid dream
But when the time comes
Could we take it back to wherever it started from
Could we take it back to wherever it started from

So where are we going to
Where are we going to
Where are we going to

So we can make our promise
But who's to say if it will keep
I know that's how you want it
Wish I could say the same for me
So who knows what's held for us in store
I secretly wish I knew for sure
But when the time comes when the time comes
Then we'll take it back could we take it back 
could we take it back to wherever it started from
Could we take it back to wherever it started from
Take it back to wherever it started from
Could we take it back take it back

She told me to eat well and try to love myself
Then maybe I won't wish that I was someone else
(Tell me how, tell me how)
To be more like you

Look, I don't wanna fight
No, I just wanna swap our bodies for a day
Imagine I could drive
With the top down
Back and forth across LA
And every time she mentions your name
She says it like a prayer
Getting caught up on the syllables
I wish I didn't care, but no
Oh, maybe I'm the one she had to outgrow



Oh, I heard it from a woman on the internet
She told me to eat well and try to love myself
Then maybe I won't wish that I was someone else
Oh, I know that I've been flirting with the enemy
But please don't be so perfect right in front of me
I think of all the things that I will never be
(Tell me how, tell me how)
To be more like you


To be more like you
Be more like
To be more like you
(To be more like you)
To be more like you
Be more like
To be more like you


And look
It's true, it's true, it's true, it's true
I got these insecurities
They're all mine, there's nothing you can
Do, do, do, do, no
And look
It's true, it's true, it's true, it's true
The other day I caught myself
Just looking at pictures of you
You, you, you, you, no



Oh, I heard it from a woman on the internet
She told me to live a life of no regret
So maybe I won't take you on as such a threat
Tell me how, tell me how
Oh, I know that I've been flirting with the enemy
But please don't be so perfect right in front of me
I think of all the things that I will never be
(Tell me how, tell me how)
To be more like you


To be more like you
Be more like
To be more like you
(To be more like you)
To be more like you
Be more like
To be more like you

 Leave it all behind
 You made it through these rough waters

 So many times to start over
 So many ways to begin

 There's no need to slip away
 Hold my word

Honeymoon
Unexpected this thing that we fell into
Lie so connected
You came at a time
When my heart was selective
Didn't have to choose my love
Was accepted yeah
Now we're running out of luck one on one
You were sent to me like a one of one
And now we're going I just want no one
Nobody else
I hope we never change
I hope we stay the same
I hope that we can love through the pain
After the honeymoon fades
I hope we never change
I hope we stay the same
I hope we can love through the pain
After the honeymoon fades

I remember when we met we were all
In each other's bed
We were spending every second we had
And now that it's official it
Ended a little different
How we're gonna deal
With these bads no yeah
Now we're running out of luck one on one
You were sent to me like a one of one
And now we're going I just want no one

128,Better Than Feeling Lonely,Olivia O'Brien(올리비아 오브라이언),"Hate to say it's true but I can't get you off my mind
 Thinking 'bout your body, how it feels when it's on mine
 I know all you're gonna do is sit and waste my time
 And every word you say to me is probably a lie

 So look me in the eyes, tell me that you want me
 Tell me pretty lies, tell me I'm the only
 Even if you don't mean it, touching you is holy
 Maybe fake love is better than feeling lonely

 Better than feeling lonely
 Better than feeling lonely
 Better than feeling
 Maybe fake love is better than feeling lonely

 (Maybe fake love is better than feeling lonely)

 Wish that I could be someone who does everything right
 But that just seems so boring, I would rather chase the highs

 I've got some stories I still need to write
 And I don't care if that shit fucks up my life
 So call me a psycho and maybe you're right
 But I love it

 So look me in the eyes, tell me that you want me
 Tell me pretty lies, tell me I'm the only
 Even if you don't mean it, touching you is holy
 Maybe fake love is better than feeling lonely

 Better than feeling lonely
 Better than feeling lonely
 Better than feeling
 Maybe fake love is better than feeling lonely

 I'd rather love and lose than never even get to love you
 I don't care if I get hurt, I'm fine
 I don't get to choose, the way I feel is just a true love
 And I don't care if I get hurt, I'm fine

 So look me in the eyes, tell me that you want me
 Tell me pretty lies, tell me I'm the only
 Even if you don't mean it, touching you is holy
 Maybe fake love is better than feeling lonely

 Better than feeling lonely
 Better than feeling lonely
 Better than feeling
 Maybe fake love is better than feeling lonely

132,All My Friends,DVNA,"Verse 1: 
I get so reminiscent, of when I didn’t give a fuck 
Back in the day when instant, meant noodles in a cup 
And our ideas weren’t twisted on what it takes to feel loved 
Now our flaws are like symptoms of never being enough 

Pre: 
You’re think we’re so impatient 
Way too self-obsessed 
We don’t know what work is, how can we be so stressed 
You say we’ve said goodbye to 
All our dignity 
Now validation’s our currency so... 

Chorus: 
All my friends are crazy 
Anxiety so trendy it’s gone mainstream 
I raise a glass to all confused and dazed too 
This world’s so damaged I don’t even blame you 

Verse 2: 
Future, a new reality 
We’d have phased out imperfection and what it means to be unique 
My waist would be so damn small cause I can’t afford to eat 
Maybe then I’d be happy with myself maybe then I can breathe 

Pre: 
You think we’re so damn anxious 
Think we’re so depressed 
If it’s so easy why’s it, harder to connect? 
We all told to stay woke 
There ain’t no time for sleep when all our standards getting hard to meet so.. 

Chorus: 
All my friends are crazy 
Anxiety so trendy it’s gone mainstream 
I raise a glass to all confused and dazed too 
This worlds so damaged I don’t even blame you 

Bridge: 
Precious butterfly under smoky sky 
Dodging water guns under tea stained suns 
If I took your pain, please tell me you’d stay 
Promise that I’d do whatever it takes

'Cause I was listening this morning
On my own thinking if I could
I'd be kathy and make this bus a greyhound
And this sun would always stay down
And there would be so much time for us
Time for us
My hand's out I wanna throw my cards now
Making your name our hometown
But all my trains are here
Please don't be worried
No doubt I'll found you in our old crowd
So many things to say if you stay
So stay young
I know that I'm talking too much
And I'll get nowhere tryna do it at once
But oh my god I wanna be someone
So stay young
With me 'cause I hope that it's you
That I'll break my back tryna run home to
Because oh my god I want you to be the one
So stay young
I wanna say it like simon would
I wanna make my mother feel things
I wanna have the marching band
But right now it's just me
And steel strings lonely
So when I miss you it is slowly
'Cause I'm doing good here
Mostly on my own
Mostly on my own
My hand's out I wanna throw my cards now
Making your name our hometown
But all my trains are here
Please don't be worried
No doubt I'll found you in our old crowd
So many things to say if you stay
So stay young
I know that I'm talking too much
And I'll get nowhere tryna do it at once
But oh my god I wanna be someone
So stay young

That I'll break my back tryna run home to
Because oh my god
I want you to be the one
So stay young
Oh oh woah oh
Oh stay young
Oh woah
(Stay young)
And I promise I care
I know it's hard know that I'm never there
But call me from the bathroom
When you're low
We'll stay young until we wanna be old
Electric blankets so we're never cold
'Cause you have always been my ticket home
And we stayed young
So stay young
I know that I'm talking too much
And I'll get nowhere tryna do it at once
But oh my god I wanna be someone
(Be someone)
So stay young
With me 'cause I hope that it's you
That I'll break my back tryna run home to
Because oh my god
I want you to be the one the one
So stay young
Oh oh woah oh
Oh stay young
Oh woah
Oh stay young

 I been thinking that you always worked out
 Living in LA now
 But I swear you move like you come from the south
 When we getting private
 You show me tricks you don't show no one else
 I wonder where you learned that
 Want you to show me

 Oh I can tell that you're a pro girl 'cause you do it right

 In and outta jeans, girl
 Makes no difference to me to see you outta tune

 Then I lay back, let you get on top
 See if you can join the bike club
 First you told me you don't like clubs
 Unless you see it's the right one
 Outta all the girls that left
 I'm starting to think you're the right one
 We make a movie and sequel
 We don't need siskle and eber
 I'm like an eagle that's eager
 I turn to a beast when I need you
 Wait 'til the dark when I see you

Stop breathe it in for the moment
Stop give it a minute and you'll own it
Stop only just begun
Soon it'll be almost over so just
Stop see what comes into focus
Stop kind of crazy what you'll notice
Stop like a setting sun
Soon it'll be almost over
Stop
Stop
Stop

We can finally see each other if we
Stop breathe it in for the moment
Stop give it a minute and you'll own it
Stop only just begun
Soon it'll be almost over so just
Stop see what comes into focus

Stop like a setting sun

In a bubble with you
And I can't seem to shake that

In a bubble with you
And I can't seem to shake that
Might be my biggest fan

You're stressing me out
I need a hideout

Can I write my name on your sneakers?

Can we sit and watch TV?

Sat by me in every class
Didn't think much of it at the time who knew
My inhibitions falling fast
But I've been patient sittin' waiting
I guess it wasn't enough

눈물 흘린 날들이었기에
많은 약속들이 그리도 무거웠나요
그대와도 작별을 건넬 줄이야
오랫동안 꽃피우던 시절들이
이다지도 찬 바람에 흩어지네
천천히 멀어져 줘요 내게서
나와 맺은 추억들 모두
급히 돌아설 것들이었나
한밤의 꿈처럼 잊혀져가네
날 위로할 때만 아껴 부를 거라던
나의 이름을 낯설도록
서늘한 목소리로 부르는 그대
한번 옛 모습으로 안아주오
천천히 멀어져줘요 내게서
나와 맺은 추억들 모두
급히 돌아설 것들이었나
한밤의 꿈처럼 잊혀져가
별빛도 슬피 기우네요
서서히 내 마음 비추던 첫 모습의 당신
아름다웠네 그늘진 날마저
난 한 걸음마다 회상할 테죠

미련 없이 커져서
한없이 꿈을 꾸었네
별을 참 많이
세고 또 세어서

I hope he's home for you, even though I had to lose you
You define who fills your heart, even if I'm not the one you choose

I thought I caught a glimpse of me and you
In our kitchen, where I cooked your favorite food
And if I'm being honest, I was a fool
So say the word, and I'll come running back to you

And you're full of love and wild and free
Chasing every dream and possibility
You're more than I could ever be...

Street runner
Gotta stop running sometimes
I'm in your city tonight
And these lights
Make me feel so inspired
Going higher and higher and higher
Taking me higher
Higher and higher and higher
Hey I'm kinda glad you didn't pick up
I kinda just called to hear your voice so
Your voice recording was enough
Ugh I should hang up what am I doing? Um
So uh I feel kinda dumb but uh
I miss you I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about our love
And how much I miss your touch
I miss being around you
Hearing your laugh and holding your hand
I think of you every day
I hope and I wish that you're doing okay
I want us to go back to the old days
Because I miss you
And I just thought of you
So I thought I'd call you
To tell you that you cross my mind
And I took that as a sign
That I should call and say hi
So that's all hi
I hope you don't think I've lost my mind
I hope you don't think I'm crazy
This message is getting long
So I just say bye but
The idea of you listening to this
The thought of you
I can't hang up
I'm in your city tonight
And these lights make me feel so inspired
Going higher and higher and higher"
216,Peace Be Still,Adria Kain,"I'm alone all the time
‘Cus its madness
And its chaos
Moving through my mind
Creeping in my life
Is a monster
Made of fear and sadness alive
Inside of my head
I've tried to let go of all the things
I don't like here
Despite all the nightmares
I realigned with myself
And who I choose to be today
With or without the things that I want
Is better than anything else
Peace
Peace be still
Peace
Peace be still
Mmmm yeah
I'd rather be caught up
Sitting pretty while I'm sipping on a Paloma
At a spot right outside of the Casa Loma
Frankincense the aroma
And I really wish I didn't feel so alone
Where I'm living is not my home
But I'm holding onto faith
I can't let it get away
If I could change just one thing in my life
I'd turn it into a paradise
Where the water's made of magic
And the garden grows golden leaves
So I can be still
Peace
Peace be still
Peace
Peace be still"
222,We're Good,Dua Lipa(두아 리파),"I'm on an island
Even when you're close
Can't take the silence
I'd rather be alone
I think it's pretty plain and simple
We gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we
Should and say we're good
Chrorus
We're not meant to be
Like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least
Agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge
You when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't
Be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we
Should and say we're good
No need to hide it
Go get what you want
This won't be a burden
If we both don't hold a grudge
I think it's pretty plain and simple
We gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we
Should and say we're good
Chrorus
We're not meant to be
Like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least
Agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge
You when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't
Be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we
Should and say we're good
Mid 8
Now you're holding this against me
Like I knew you would
I tried my best to make this easy
So don't give me that
Look just say we're good
We're not meant to be
Like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least
Agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge
You when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't
Be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we
Should and say we're good"
224,Let Her,Esperanza Spalding(에스페란자 스팔딩),"You just walked in to the quiet quiet after the stars yes 
It's such silent and you sense that something's wrong 
Hmmm something's surely wrong 
And you saw the letter the keys laying on the counter 
But you know just what it means and grab the phone to call her 

Now is this another awful good threat 
She made cool jokes or she made good these threats to finally leave you 
Tears roll up in your eyes which you won't let you cry and finally 

Chorus 
She's gone bye bye so long 
Let her 
She's gone bye bye so long 
Love goes on 

Apartment stripped in silence 
Still you hear each make up 
And all those crazy ways you forgive loved you 
Now that you're all alone 
You realize she filled your life with litter 
Her kisses used to thrill 
Now the after taste is bitter 
With the memories from the mess you've endured when 

Chorus 
She's gone bye bye so long 
Let her 
She's gone bye bye so long 
Love goes on"
226,John Hughes Movie,Maisie Peters,"This wasn't how it's sposed to go
I should be the one you're dancing with
Spinning with a vodka coke
Everybody at my fingertips
I was gonna get my coat
And baby you were meant to follow me
And I was gonna act surprised
Even though I'd know you wanted me
It's not like I've been crying
There's just smoke in my eyes
Coz this aint no John Hughes movie
Where the girl gets the guy
You look right through me
Everytime you walk by
I keep waiting for the heartbreak music
That's never gonna come
Coz if you don't want me
Then you're not the one
Sitting on the bathroom floor
Tryna get my composure back
Think I built it up too tall
Knew I should've worn my adidas
Maybe if I'd reigned it in
You wouldn't wanna kiss somebody else
And you don't owe me anything so I'm
Just gonna walk home by myself
It's not like I've been crying
There's just smoke in my eyes
Coz this aint no John Hughes movie
Where the girl gets the guy
You look right through me
Everytime you walk by
I keep waiting for the heartbreak music
That's never gonna come
Coz if you don't want me
Then you're not the one
What am I gonna say what am I gonna do
All of our stupid friends
Know that I'm here for you
Guess I misunderstood
Thought you liked me too
What am I gonna say what am I gonna do
Everyone told me so
Don't wait around for you
Guess I misunderstood
Thought you liked me too
Coz this aint no John Hughes movie
Where the girl gets the guy
You look right through me
Everytime you walk by
I keep waiting for the heartbreak music
That's never gonna come
Coz if you don't want me
Then you're not the one
Not the one no no no you're not the one
You're not the one not the one no
You're not the one not the one
No not the one tho"

And give me your hand darling
Do you feel my heart beating
Do you understand?
Do you feel the same?
Or am I only dreaming
Or is this burning an eternal flame?

It's meant to be darling
I watch you when you are sleeping
You belong with me
Do you feel the same?
Or am I only dreaming
Or is this burning an eternal flame?
Say my name yeah
Sun shines through the rain
My whole life so lonely
But then come and ease the pain yeah
I don't want to lose this feeling oh oh yeah
Just close your eyes
And give me your hand my darling

235,Popular Song (feat. Ariana Grande),Mika(미카),"La la, la la
You were the popular one, the popular chick
It is what it is, now I'm popularish
Standing on the field with your pretty pompons
Now you're working at the movie selling popular corn
I could have been a mess but I never went wrong
Cause I'm putting down my story in a popular song
Said I'm putting down my story in a popular song
My problem, I never was a model,
I never was a scholar,
You were always popular,
You were singing, all the songs I don't know
Now you're in the front row
Cause my song is popular
Popular, I know about popular
It's not about who you are or your fancy car
You're only ever who you were
Popular, I know about popular
And all that you have to do is be true to you
That's all you ever need to know
Catch up cause you got an awful long way to go
Catch up cause you got an awful long way to go
Always on the lookout for someone to hate,
Picking on me like a dinner plate
I'd hid during classes, and in between them
Dunk me in the toilets, now it's you that cleans them
You tried to make me feel bad with the thing you do
It ain't so funny when the joke's on you
Uh, the joke's on you
Got everyone's laughing, got everyone clapping, asking
How come you look so cool?
Cause that's the only thing that I've learned at school
So that's the only thing I've learned at school
My problem, I never was a model,
I never was a scholar,
You were always popular,
You were singing, all the songs I don't know
Now you're in the front row

243,Selfish,Jack Gray,"You play my heart like I play my guitar
Break all the strings cause I play way too hard
As fake as it sounds it was real from the start
Passion is everything until it's not

I could tell it was downhill from here
I reversed engineered a plan out of my fears
They grew strong (way too strong)
I'll hold on (not for long)
Was surprised this ain't where I belong

Growing distant you could tell
I hate sleeping by myself
Is it selfish? I can't help it
Slowing drifting miles apart
Save yourself I'm crashing hard
Call it selfish I can't help it

I lie awake in my bed till it's dawn
It didn't get easier guess I was wrong
Scared to let go of what's already gone
Passion is everything until it's not

I could tell it was downhill from here
I look back on the years you held back but your tears
We're too strong (way too strong)
I'll hold on (not for long)
Was surprised this ain't where I belong

Growing distant you could tell
I hate sleeping by myself
Is it selfish? I can't help it
Slowing drifting miles apart
Save yourself I'm crashing hard
Call it selfish I can't help it"

And I know you feel the same as me
When our eyes meet
Can't help but smile from my head to feet
I'm yours
And I'm never gonna leave
You're all I ever need
You heal my cuts and
Bruises with your loving energy
And it always calms
My nerves to know you're there for me
You'll buy a ring for me some day
But when the diamonds start to fade
We'll get a tattoo of our names
So we will always bе the same
That way thesе things will never change
Can't speak
My jokes aren't funny but you laugh with me
Don't sleep
'Cause we laugh so
Much at our midnight feast
I'm yours
And I'm never gonna leave
You're all I ever need
You heal my cuts and
Bruises with your loving energy
And it always calms
My nerves to know you're there for me
You'll buy a ring for me some day
But when the diamonds start to fade
We'll get a tattoo of our names
So we will always be the same
That way these things will never change
Oh uh oh oh

And you don't even know I've been
Trying hard to say something to you
I want you to know that I'm here

Damn you drive me crazy
Walking thru the city with you
Just like other people would do
Late night movies in my bedroom
Get some coffee in the morning
I can drive from the east to the west side
Going on a road trip watch the sunrise
Every little things gon be so special
As long as I'm with you
I've been trying to get your attention lately
But you're going away from me

Laughing to a honey scrub
Bee sting on my bit bit
Blah Blah Blah
Smile like a baby
Talk just like a lady
Coconut buttercup honey creme daily
Sugar got me crazy
Water got me high
Don't have time to be shady
You know why
You know why
You know why
I'm the crazy daughter from a sweet
Sweet mother
And a wild father
Got some funny sisters
We make sugar water
We make sugar
I'm the crazy daughter from a sweet
Sweet mother
And a wild father
Got some funny sisters
We make sugar water
Sugar
Foggy dewy mist mist
Drips down glass like cold tears
Soaking release my fears
Drowning in this damn day
Hell was looking my way
Buckle up buttercup ice cream day
I'm the crazy daughter from a sweet
Sweet mother
And a wild father
Got some funny sisters
We make sugar water
We make sugar
I'm the crazy daughter from a sweet
Sweet mother
And the wild father
Got some funny sisters
We make sugar water
We make sugar

The day is gone
You got to move on
Lively lies
And blue sun sun sun
I won't let it define my life"

Are you free for the day
I know you cake on the makeup
Cuz you don't wanna face
That you're lost in the patterns
But you paint anyways
Ya i know what your feeling
Cause I’m feeling it too
We’re dancing at the party
They’re filling up the room
But I don’t see nobody
Nobody else but you
We hate the taste of captain
Let’s make it feel brand new
If I’ve done it a thousand times again
i’ll do it with you too
Heard you’re done with the small talk
You'd Rather cut to the chase
Hang your heart in a chapel
But they force you to date
Oh I'll try to be different
If you meet me tonight
We could spill our secrets
And the scripts we can’t rewrite
Done trying to be cool
We're spinning around
Caught in the crowd
Hoping it dies down slowly
And if I step on your feet
I hope you won’t leave
We'll be together lonely"
251,nothing else i could do,ella jane,"I waited up for your call
You never told me you would
But the way that you smiled was a promise, I swear

Fell asleep by the phone
I missed a message or two
Deleted them 'cause they weren't you

I wrecked my house a hundred times just to see you walk into a room
But there was money in your laugh, so babe

There's nothing else I could do
Oh babe, there's nothing else I could do
(There's nothing else I could)

I miss the shape of your voice
I miss the nape of your neck
I miss the weight of your words
I miss the bruises they left

Started reading the Times
Just to look for your name -
I couldn't find it
They must have made a mistake

I broke my knuckles in a fight, you were crying in the back of the room
And now the world is on fire, but babe

There's nothing else I could do
Oh babe, there's nothing else I could do
(Oh)

And they can dance to the songs
And they can drink all the wine
Because the high might be theirs
But all the bottles were mine

And then you're crashing my car
And now I'm taking the blame
There's nothing else I could do
They must have made a mistake

Oh

Babe, they must have made a mistake
Oh
They must have made a mistake
Oh babe, there's nothing else I could do
Oh babe, there's nothing else I could do
There's nothing else I could-"

Hope it don't go the way it should
Hope he don't treat you like I could
So call me when it's over
Tell me when you're done

I can be the shoulder
The shoulder to cry on
A heart to rely on
I know at times I made mistakes
Wish I could blow them all away
Won't you believe me when I say
I'm so much better now I've changed
I've only got myself to blame
Call me when it's over
Tell me when you're done

I think about you and when the sun comes up

On my feet with you right by my side
And it's you that's on my mind
Watching the TV
I got my favourite shows and
Snacks and I got you right in between
But I don't think that you should leave
Yeah
Some nights I'll remember
Remember how we stayed up late
Remember all the songs we sang and played
Oh those nights I'll remember
From watching the sun's shining light move
Down your face until the dark midnight

I fall asleep wrapped up
In your arms so tight
And every time you must say goodbye
I cannot let you walk out the door tonight

You've caught me in your arms
Baby please don't let me go
Now that you're right here with me
I finally feel so good and free
Just say that I'm your
Girl and it's us against the world
Some nights I'll remember
Remember how we stayed up late
Remember all the songs we sang and played
Oh those nights I'll remember
From watching the sun's shining light move
Down your face until the dark midnight
Some nights I'll remember

That I'm seeing somebody
There's not a nice way for me to say that
I've been seeing somebody
You know I want you to be happy
Since I'm seeing somebody
And then maybe we can get on with it

Stay out late I just wanna get stoned
Telling all your friends that I'm never at home
And my face filling up with blood
But you're still saying 
They don't like your bourgeois
Coughing up the promethazine
Living like an evergreen
Sorry for the things that I've done
Now Selena won't be friends with me
I was kissing Emily
I love you it was never your fault

You wore a dark gray t shirt
You told me I was pretty
When I looked like a mess

It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
Oh oh yeah yeah oh
Today was a fairytale"
259,Don't You Worry,Oh Wonder(오 원더),"We walked the city streets
At midnight when the world went quiet
We skipped our dancing
Feet along beside the taxi rides
If I'm honest it felt like love
And all the beats fell in
Between the silence that we shared
And all the trees were swaying
Softly in the thick black air
If I'm honest it felt like love
And you said stay here darling
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
I'm right here darling
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
It's us against the world
It's us against the world
It's us against the world
We let the freckles on
Our faces make a million stars
A constellation so amazing
That we saw a spark
If I'm honest it felt like love
And in the morning
You adored me 'til the sun went down
And then I knew you were
The one I couldn't live without
If I'm honest it felt like love
And you said stay here darling
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
I'm right here darling
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
It's us against the world
It's us against the world
It's us against the world
We built a little house and
Filled it with our little dreams
But shining brighter are
The moments that were in between
If I'm honest it felt like love
And now we're ready for the ending
We're hand in hand
A life so colorful
We didn't even need a plan
If I'm honest it feels like love
And you said stay here darling
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
I'm right here darling
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
It's us against the world
It's us against the world
It's us against the world
So stay here darling
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
I'm right here darling
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
It's us against the world
It's us against the world
It's us against the world"
260,You,Charlotte Lawrence(샬롯 로렌스),"Go ahead, you can say it's my fault
 Doesn't really matter at all
 Ticking time bomb, watch it explode
 It's not like we could stop it at all
 Hold me closer, I'm your virgin
 Only God can save us now
 Go ahead, you can say it's my fault
 It doesn't really matter

 It's you, and all the things you do
 I know it could be anybody
 It should be anybody else
 Loving you makes me hate you too
 I know it could be anybody
 It should be anybody else
 But it's you, you, you, you, you

 Waking up still wearing your clothes
 I take a little piece of you home
 When my mom says ""Where'd you get those?""
 Just laugh and say ""I already know""
 Pull me closer, tiny dancer
 Only God can save us now
 Go to bed still wearing your clothes
 It doesn't even matter

 It's you, and all the things you do
 I know it could be anybody
 It should be anybody else
 Loving you makes me hate you too
 I know it could be anybody
 It should be anybody else
 But it's you, you, you, you, you
 But it's you, you, you, you, you

 I'll try acting crazy
 Knowin' that you'll save me
 Laugh it off and take me home
 Caught me saying, baby
 Something's different lately
 It's better if it's left alone

 'Cause it's you, and all the things you do
 I know it could be anybody
 It should be anybody else
 Loving you makes me hate you too
 I know it could be anybody
 It should be anybody else
 But it's you, you, you, you, a-ah
 But it's you, you, you, you, you, you"
262,Love Is A Compass (Disney supporting Make-A-Wish),Griff,"Moments they've been everything
And just like magic
Can make the whole world sing
That look in your eyes
Oh the joy it brings
When I hold you and you hold me
I know we're not not what we used to be
But we carry so much history
Put up my sails and I rode the wind
That led me here to you I'd do it all again
I know it won't always be the same
Feelings don't change they never fade away
When you're far from home
It's hard to know the way
But it's right there inside
When you need direction
Look to the stars
If you don't know where you're heading
Follow your heart
When you're lost I will guide you
I'm right there beside you
Like a map of your memories
And just like a compass
That leads the way
We may take the long road
But I'll never fade
When you're lost I will guide you
Oh tell me you'll try to
Remember on the darker days
Love is a compass
I see you there when I'm in my dreams
And just like a child full of possibilities
I can't help but smile
At the wonders of the world
'Cause I know I've been there before
I know it won't always be the same
Feelings don't change they never fade away
When you're far from home
It's hard to know the way
But it's right there inside
When you need direction
Try close your eyes
If you don't know where you're heading
Just hold on tight
When you're lost I will guide you
'Cause I'm right here beside you
In every memory
And just like a compass
That leads the way
We may take the long road
But I'll never fade
When you're lost I will guide you
Oh tell me you'll try to
Remember on the darker days
Love is a compass"

[JUNG:]
I could be the one who wins
I would give you everything
But I know that you're still sleeping next to him
You can do better, I'm better
So why is he closer than I've been?

Your secret, so heavy for me to be carrying
You told me you were ready so
I'll wait for you

I can feel how the winds are changing
'Cause you spend all your nights here lately
Hold me close, are you gonna let him go?
I don't know if I'm going crazy
Thinking you're gonna leave your safety
Hold me close, are you gonna let him go?

[Clara Mae:]
We could be the lucky ones
If we stay 'til morning comes
I don't know why I keep going back to him
I can do better, you're better
Tell me you won't let me down

[JUNG & Clara Mae:]
It feels like we're slipping
You're here but you're distant
You told me you were ready so
I'll wait for you

I can feel how the winds are changing
'Cause you spend all your nights here lately
Hold me close, are you gonna let him go?
I don't know if I'm going crazy
Thinking you're gonna leave your safety
Hold me close, are you gonna let him go?

I move slowly out of bed
Real quiet getting dressed
So sure you're sleeping still
Where you going? Where you going?
Won't you come back to bed?
Did you forget about the things you said?
You shouldn't leave just yet
Where you going? Where you going?

I can feel how the winds are changing
'Cause you spend all your nights here lately
Hold me close, are you gonna let him go?
I don't know if I'm going crazy
Thinking you're gonna leave your safety
Hold me close, are you gonna let him go?"

Am I lookin' for a light that's,
that's just not on? That's just not there?
Am I lookin' lover in the arms of
someone new? Don't care
Am I lookin' for a future
when there might not even be a now?
Am I tryin' to buy a house
that's gonna burn down?

Just tell me what it is, what it's not
Just tell me, are we on? Are we off?
'Cause falling for you's always
such a long way down
You're drinkin' and it's real late at night
That's when you're good at
changing your mind
But if we're better off alone
Why did you pick up your phone?
Why did you pick up your phone?

Is it love? Is it strange
that I can feel the danger
If we leave it in-between?
Are we lost? Are we fine?
Don't wanna wait around
Matches, meet the gasoline
Tryin' to go, tryin' to stay
We're gettin' nowhere goin' both ways
So tired of the guessin'

Just tell me what it is, what it's not
Just tell me, are we on? Are we off?
'Cause falling for you's always
such a long way down
You're drinkin' and it's real at night
That's when you're good at
changing your mind
But if we're better off alone
Why did you pick up your phone?
Why did you pick up your phone?

So just tell me what it is, what it's not

268,To The Sky,Owl City(아울 시티),"I used to call you after midnight
It was cold 'cause we both agreed
We were easy kinda weakly
Shipwreck in a sea of faces
There's a dreamy world up there
Dear friends in higher places
Carry me away from here
Travel light
Let the sun eclipse you
'Cause your flight
Is about to leave
And there's more to this
Brave adventure
Than you'd ever believe
Birds eye view
Awake the stars
'Cause they're all around you
Wide eyes will always
Brighten the blue
Chase your dreams
And remember me
Sweet bravery
'Cause after all those wings
Will take you
Up so high
So bid the forest floor goodbye
As you race the wind
And take to the sky
You take to the sky
On the hills of war and wonder
There's a stormy world up there
You can't whisper
Above the thunder
But you can fly anywhere
Purple burst of paper birds
This picture paints
A thousand words
So take a breath
Of myth and mystery
And don't look back
Birds eye view
Awake the stars
'Cause they're all around you
Wide eyes will always
Brighten the blue
Chase your dreams
And remember me
Sweet bravery
'Cause after all those wings
Will take you
Up so high
So bid the forest floor goodbye
As you race the wind
And take to the sky
You take to the sky
There's a realm above the trees
Where the lost are finally found
So touch your feathers
To the breeze
And leave the ground
Birds eye view
Awake the stars
'Cause they're all around you
Wide eyes will
Always brighten the blue
Chase your dreams
And remember me
Sweet bravery
'Cause after all those wings
Will take you
Up so high
So bid the forest floor goodbye
As you race the wind
And take to the sky
You take to the sky
You take to the sky"
269,Love You For A Long Time,Maggie Rogers(매기 로저스),"Came in like a vision from the old west wind
 Like a bright new dream that I was stepping in
 I saw your face and I knew it was a sign
 And I still think about that moment all of the time

 You know that I could never make this up
 I found the reason I'm not giving up
 I felt the fever and I knew he was mine
 Oh I, I'm gonna love you for a long time

 And in the morning when I'm waking up
 I swear that you're the first thing that I'm thinking of
 I feel it in my body, know it in my mind
 Oh I, I'm gonna love you for a long time
 I'm gonna love you for a long time
 I'm gonna love you for a long time

 Oh, I never it, yeah, you took me by surprise
 While I was getting lost so deep inside your diamond eyes
 So many things that I still wanna say
 And if devotion is a river, then I'm floating away

 And in the morning when you pick me up
 And all the world is quiet, tip the mourning dove
 I feel it in my body, know it in my mind
 Oh I, I'm gonna love you for a long time
 I'm gonna love you for a long time
 I'm gonna love you for a long time

 Ooh, don't slow down now, gonna break me down
 Keep your hands in my hair, keep your mouth on my mouth
 Don't slow this down, never let me go
 Baby, don't you wanna see how far this thing can go?

 And in the morning when you wake me up
 I know that forever could never be enough
 I feel it in my body, know it in my mind
 Oh I, I'm gonna love you for a long time
 I'm gonna love you for a long time
 I'm gonna love you for a long time
 For a long time

 Oh, I'm gonna love you for a long time
 Ooh, I'm gonna love you for a long time
 Yeah, I'm gonna love you for a long time
 Won't you keep me, let me love you for a long time?
 For a long, long, long, long time
 I'm gonna love you for a long time"

Listening to static on the radio
Smoke some, hold it in
We might never get the chance to live again
Looks like the world is ending
Yeah, so kiss me

Yeah, maybe I shouldn't drive
We could post up here for the night
Faded off those big brown eyes
Cooped up with you is my vibe, yeah (Yeah)
I was cynical turned me to a believer (Hey)
Turn the heat up to a hundred degrees, yeah (Ooh)
And I'm new to love but you said, ""I'ma teach ya"" (Ayy)
I'ma give you the sauce like I'm making pizza (Sauce)
I been waiting all my life to
Find a little bad one I could give my life to
Screaming, ""Hallelujah,"" how did I find you?
'Cause you got that body but I want your mind too
This feels like a movie in the 80's
Dirty dancing on me like I'm Patrick Schwayze
Now we in the Chevy things are getting crazy
Yeah, so baby

Kiss me in the backseat of my new Tahoe
Listening to static on the radio
Smoke some, hold it in
We might never get the chance to live again
Looks like the world is ending
Yeah, so kiss me

Yeah, following the vibe, no time for questions
Used to over think, a second guesser
You got me on autopilot like a Telsa
On a s*x drive and you cut the tension
Yeah, you love the taste of my tattoos
Yeah, and your girlies say that I'm bad news
Yeah, from the second we met, had to have you
So let me ask you, is this what you imagined? Yeah
'Cause I never thought this would happen, yeah
Now the whole world's going up in flames
But right now nothing matters

And go walk around the mall
Cause when I'm sippin' on the magical juice
I'm willy wonka and
I'm swimming through the colorful hues
Life is really just a lemon
That you don't get to choose

You should see the way the light dances off your hair
A million colours of hazel, golden and red
Saturday morning is fading
The suns reflected by the coffee in your hand
My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again

We were love drunk waiting on a miracle
Trying to find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh I won’t be silent and I won’t let go
I will hold on tighter ‘til the afterglow
And we’ll burn so bright ‘til the darkness softly clears

Oh I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh I will hold on to the afterglow

The weather outside’s changing
The leaves are buried under six inches of white
The radio is playing, Iron & Wine
This is a new dimension 
This is a level where we’re losing track of time
I’m holding nothing against it, except you and I 

We were love drunk waiting on a miracle
Trying to find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh I won’t be silent and I won’t let go
I will hold on tighter ‘til the afterglow
And we’ll burn so bright ‘til the darkness softly clears

Oh I will hold on to the afterglow

 I hate holding babies
 And people tryna save me

 Where you pay for God's forgiveness

 Politicians are annoying

 And old music was better

 The show Friends was overrated
 I think rich kids have it easy
 And PDA is creepy
 The Internet's obnoxious

 I think marijuana's classy
 And doing coke is trashy

Catch a vibe who knows we might
Just waste away the daylight
Gotta pay that rent
It's stacking up
Gotta get to work
The weekends done
When the world is calling you
Don't pick up
Come on come on
Driving into morning light
Come on come on
Let the world just pass us by
Come on come on
Get tattoos who knows we might
Just waste away the daylight
Come on come on
No one on the 405
Come on come on
Let the world just pass us by
Come on come on
Catch a vibe who knows we might
Just waste away the daylight
Just waste away the daylight"
303,Real Thing,La Felix,"I would be lying if I said I knew
Just what I'm doing talking to you
I don't know if it's crazy
The thoughts in my head
But you believe me oh if I say
This could be the way to the real thing
There's something you can buy
With your credit card
It feels so natural
But you could have known me
This could be the way to the real thing
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh could've known
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh so can I go
I think I really feel down in my soul that
This could be the way to the real thing
We could go out and take on the night
Or take it easy whatever feels right
And I take you to places
Where you wanna go
Do you believe me now when I say
This could be the way to the real thing
There's something you can buy
With your credit card
I feels so natural
But you could have known me
This could be the way to the real thing
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh could've known
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh so can I go
I think I really feel down in my soul that
This could be the way to the real thing
Real thing

Just follow me
Think we could be
Forever
Real thing

304,33 Days (feat. gnash & Anna Clendening),Keenan,"It's been 33 days
Since I've seen your face
And not a damn thing's changed
Since I drove by your place
I was hopin' and I'm prayin'
That one day you will change
But it's been 33 days
And you're still the same
I don't feel like I felt when I fell for you
And I don't and I won't say I miss you too
You had me feeling like I was the crazy one
Lies wrapped up 'till we came undone
Had love gave love but you gave me up
Fuck
You stole my heart and we grew apart
You charged my card up you totaled my car
I dealt with all that shit I never called it quits
Woke up one morning then called
And said all of this
Hello?
It's been 33 days
Since I've seen your face
And not a damn thing's changed
Since you begged me to stay
You told me it'd be different
And one day you would change
But it's been 33 days
And you're still the same
I don't need you you you
You had me me me
Fool me once twice three
Now I see see see
I don't need you you you
You had me me me
Fool me once twice three
So let me breathe
Please"
306,Everything Sucks (Frank Walker Remix),Scott Helman,"I'm feeling sick
Think it's contagious
Don't wanna see
Nobody but you
I haven't tripped
But I can taste it
Don't wanna heal
For somebody new
Every single minute every second
I can hear my heart is whispering
Baby are you listening?
Everything sucks
I got fucked up on you
Give everything that I'll ever have
Just to get you back
That's some bad luck
'Cause I'm not done with you
Think about you on somebody else
I wanna kill myself
Everything sucks (Sucks sucks sucks sucks)
Everything sucks (Sucks sucks sucks sucks)
Without you
You're on my lips
In conversation
Don't wanna talk
'Bout nothing but you
My friends are pissed
Can't stop complaining
Get over it
But what can I do?
Every single minute every second
I can hear my heart is whispering
Baby are you listening?
Everything sucks
I got fucked up on you
Give everything that I'll ever have
Just to get you back
That's some bad luck
'Cause I'm not done with you
Think about you on somebody else
I wanna kill myself
Everything sucks (Sucks sucks sucks sucks)
Everything sucks (Sucks sucks sucks sucks)
Without you
Sleeping outside your residence
Hoping you come and let me in
Guess I probably burned that bridge
When I was crying on your front stop
Playing sad songs just to pretend
I'm not pathetic but you know I am
Can't see the bright side of anything
Without you it's like
Everything sucks
I got fucked up on you
Give everything that I'll ever have
Just to get you back
That's some bad luck
'Cause I'm not done with you
Think about you on somebody else
I wanna kill myself
Everything sucks (Sucks sucks sucks sucks)
Everything sucks (Sucks sucks sucks sucks)
Without you (Sucks sucks sucks sucks)
(Sucks sucks sucks sucks)
Without you"

And the thought of giving up is sinking in

what a nice day to run away
Falling never slipping
Guess I had to learn the harder way 
3 shots pop
I don't miss
Like I'm hard-way
If I can't get it
eventually like fuck it imma get another way 
I don't believe in happiness 
I'm searching for a imma stay 
Brodie want a grave
So I showed his ass to a better place
Everybody got a plate
Everybody just fucking straight 
Walls are closing 
from the drugs I'm using 
Can't cooperate

Really hate the thought in my head
I'm out of options
Wanna blow up
My bitch kill me instead
I don't believe in happiness
I think we live and forget
I hat this test 
You called it life
We live in Gell but we blessed
And the thought of giving up is sinking in

What I nice day to run away 
I been blowing my pain away yeah
Told you that I loved
you and I meant that huh
But you won't really really
like to listen like what
I'm just tired of the same shit
Different day
You used to keep me sand
But that changed 
Had to switch lanes
Had to pass that bitch yeah
Money on my mind
I just wanna get rich
I ain't got time don't ask me if I'm fine
Told you I loved you a million times 
Told you I loved you a million times
Now that has changed

we come and go

see in just a blink 
Ain't it kinda funny how 
We can think we got it figured out

Up and down and back around again

We forget about the even now 
All the people who come in and out 
Might never come back around again 
Well it was even in my mind and 
Should've gotten you in a moment 
As I stood there in the street 
I couldn't really help but think

It's your only way to live
Three doors down and one room in
I loose my mind amongst your things

But I can't swim
It's the same it's just like then
When I was nine and you were ten
Wishing we could still be friends
Where we move is where we end

315,I Still Do,Mokita,"How could I forget that day
It's burned into my memory
And it won't ever leave
And how could I forget the way
You looked at me like an enemy
I could barely breathe
I thought things would get better
But it's taking forever
Will we ever be the same
Why does this feel so wrong
I said goodbye but I can't move on
And I'm the only one to blame
And that's why
I don't want to think about you
More than I have to
Don't wanna miss you
But I still do I still do
Was I a fool to walk away
Did love slip right through my hands
I don't want to think about you
But baby I still do
Mmmmm
Baby I still do
Mmmmm
Eight months and six days later
And no one's asked me how I'm doing
I was kinda hoping they would
And all your friends still talk to me
But they choose their words so carefully
Will I always be the enemy
I keep praying for a breakthrough
An explanation for why I hurt you
Is it wrong of me to wonder how you've been
In my closet there's a letter
That I'll send when things get better
Oh I hope that things get better
But until then
I don't want to think about you
More than I have to
Don't wanna miss you
But I still do I still do
Was I a fool to walk away
Did love slip right through my hands
I don't want to think about you
But baby I still do
Mmmmm
Baby I still do
Mmmmm
Was I a fool to walk away
Did love slip right through my hands

And you see me from the street
But I don't turn around
Would you say
Hi? Would you keep going?
If I told your friend later
That you didn't mean nothing
If you posted about it
And I didn't even comment
If the songs weren't true
But you still feel something
Would you still come looking for me?
Oh don't go reaching out
'Cause you can't have everything
Your head and your heart
Won't feel the same
Even if it feels like it every time
Don't check on me if we're not together
And it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
It ain't always summer in june
Might run across your mind
But don't worry 'bout me no
My heart is back in one piece
It ain't skipped a beat no
Feeling rested up
I ain't missing sleep no oh
Don't take it personal
If I can't reply now
I'm distant 'cause
I don't wanna be reached now
Won't let the ghosts of our past
Weigh my future down
I'm liberated
Energy's like a circle
It comes back around
Reciprocated
Don't shed no more tears
Won't gain no empathy from me
In the upcoming years
Oh I don't need your pity
Don't check on me
Oh don't check on me
If we're not together
And it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
And it looks like winter for you
Ain't call you back 'cause I let it go
I had to focus energy and just let it flow
And when we ride low
We were already gone
It wouldn't mean anymore to me now
I know it hurts you so bad
Just to see me happy
That I finally moved on
And you thought it wouldn't happen
At times I used to cry
Wouldn't know when I laughing
But I acted like I didn't notice
Oh don't go reaching out
'Cause you can't have everything
You can't kill a flame with gasoline
Even if it feels like it every time
No matter how hard you try
Don't check on me if we're not together
And it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
It ain't always summer in june
Don't check on me if we're not together
And it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
It ain't always summer in june"

And the colors all have faded into shades of gray 
There's no life in this hollow heart of mine 
Ever since you went away

Close your eyes and feel me hold you 
Can you lead me through this ordinary world
Let the sky cry, restless rain to wash away the miles 
Between us, 'cause without you it's just an ordinary world

If time could find a way to turn around 
I would walk along the stars, till I was back at your door
Every word, every word is spoken but without a sound 
And I found out what my heart is for

Close your eyes and feel me hold you 
Can you lead me through this ordinary world

Let the sky cry, restless rain to wash away the miles 
Between us, 'cause without you it's just an ordinary world

Hold your breath, here I come
Time to roll on mine 
Take back, to your arms 
Till we melt 
Underneath the blinding sun

Can't remember how to shine
You're the life in this hollow heart of mine

Close your eyes and feel me hold you 
Can you lead me through this ordinary world
Let the sky cry, restless rain to wash away the miles between us
'Till love can come redeem us 'cause without you 
It's just an ordinary World"

Soft as the cotton you lie in
Times we got hot like an iron you and I
Our hearts had never been broken
We were so innocent darling
We used to talk 'til the morning you and I
We had that mixtape on every weekend
Had it repeating had it repeating
You were my september song
Summer lasted too long
Time moves so slowly when you're only fifteen
You were my september song
Tell me where have you gone
Do you remember me? we were only fifteen
And I I remember the chorus
They were singing it for us
You were my september song
Tell me where have you gone
Do you remember me?
We were only fifteen
Sometimes I think that I see your
Face in the strangest of places
Down on the underground station passing by
I get a mad sense of danger
Feel like my heart couldn't take it
'Cause if we met we'd be strangers you and I
Still I play that mixtape every weekend
Got it repeating got it repeating
You were my september song
Summer lasted too long
Time moves so slowly when you're only fifteen
You were my september song
Tell me where have you gone?
Do you remember me? we were only fifteen
And I I remember the chorus
They were singing it for us

And I'm singing along
Thinking about you and me
Oh what a melody
And as the years go by
You will still be my be my

322,The Blower's Daughter,Damien Rice(데미안 라이스),"And so it is just like you said it would be 
Life goes easy on me most of the time 
And so it is yes the shorter story

I can't take my eyes off you 
I can't take my eyes off you 
I can't take my eyes off you 
I can't take my eyes off you 
I can't take my eyes off you 
I can't take my eyes
And so it is yes 
Just like you said it should be 
We will both forget the 
breeze most of the time 
And so it is yes the colder water

The pupil in denial 
I can't take my eyes off you 
I can't take my eyes off you 
I can't take my eyes off you 
I can't take my eyes off you 
I can't take my eyes off you 
I can't take my eyes
Did I say that I loathe you 
Did I say that I want to leave it all behind 
I can't take my mind off you 
I can't take my mind off you 
I can't take my mind off you 
I can't take my mind off you 
I can't take my mind off you 
I can't take my mind my mind my mind

323,Adelaide Sky,Adhitia Sofyan(아디티아 소프얀),"I need to know what's on your mind
These coffee cups are getting cold
Mind the people passing by
They don't know I'll be leaving soon

I'll fly away tomorrow
To far away
I'll admit a cliche
Things won't be the same without you

I'll be looking at my window 
seeing Adelaide sky
Would you be kind enough to remember
I'll be hearing my own foot steps
under Adelaide sky
Would you be kind enough to remember me

I'll let you know what's on my mind
I wish they've made you portable
Then i'll carry you around and round
I bet you'll look good on me

I'll fly away tomorrow
It's been fun
I'll repeat the cliche
Things won't be the same without you

I'll be looking at my window 
seeing Adelaide sky
Would you be kind enough to remember
I'll be hearing my own foot steps
under Adelaide sky
Would you be kind enough to remember me

I've been meaning to call you soon
But we're in different times
You might not be home now
Would you take a message
I'll try to stay awake
And fight your presence in my head

I'll be looking at my window 
seeing Adelaide sky
Would you be kind enough to remember
I'll be hearing my own foot steps
under Adelaide sky
Would you be kind enough to remember me

I'll be looking at my window 
seeing Adelaide sky
Would you be kind enough to remember
I'll be hearing my own foot steps

Would you be kind enough to remember me"

Take what you must
The rest is all mine
Ooo cuz I can’t take away
What I didn’t say
I’m gonna leave it all behind

Stars collide and burst to life tonight

You can take all the sun away
Just because
Burn this page of the past away
Cuz you can’t take the one
The one that I love

In broken mirrors I’ve seen
I’ve seen a face that looks nothing like me
Ooo you can change the light
You can turn it all to black
But you can’t change memories

Silent tears fall from the sky tonight

You can take all the sun away
Just because
Burn this page of the past away
Cuz you can’t take the one
The one that I love

I can see, just what’s in front of me here
And I can’t explain so I won’t lose
No I won’t lose what I’ve gained no no"

I know the world is black and white
Tried to keep an open mind
but I just can't sleep on this tonight.
Stop this train
I wanna get off and go home again
I can't take the speed it's moving in
I know I can't but honestly
won't someone stop this train?
Don't know how else to say it
don't want to see my parents go
one generation's length away
from fighting life out on my own
Stop this train
I wanna get off and go home again
I can't take the speed it's moving in
I know I can't but honestly
won't someone stop this train?
So scared of getting older
I'm only good at being young
So I play the numbers game
to find a way to say that life has just begun
Had a talk with my old man
Said help me understand
he said turn 68
you'll renegotiate
don't stop this train
don't for a minute change the place you're in
don't think I couldn't ever understand
I tried my hand
John honestly we'll never stop this train.
Once in a while
when it's good
it'll feel like it should
And they're all still around
And you're still safe and sound
and you don't miss a thing
'Til you cry when you're
driving away in the dark
Singing stop this train
I wanna get off and go home again
I can't take the speed it's moving in
I know I can't cause now I see
I'll never stop this train"

Me and you had to make each other happier, now theres hope with everything.

Its hard enough to feel the world as it is and hold on anything. 
Without these quiet times you've brought round here.

Im Gonna have to run away, im sure that I belong some other place. 
I've seen another side of all I've seen it keeps me wondering where my family is.

Its hard enough to see the world as it is, and hold on anything. 
Without these quiet times coming round here.

Now I miss you...
Now I want you...
But I can't have you...
Even when your here...

Suppose I have to take you with me, broken mind I'd rather leave you here.
To forget everything you've seen and known erase every idea.

And you walk up in the street, and hold my hand and smile. 
Well I won't be taken in, cus I know how it turns out. 
And it takes me back to these quiet times coming round here.

Now I miss you...
Now I want you...
Your not coming back...
And I need you...
But I can't have you...
Even when your here...

Now I miss you...

Staining your pillow with makeup?
When you're really upset

Just to do it again
Oh, what's the point in dressing up to be let down?

Aren't you tired of getting hurt?
Aren't you sick of, of making it worse?

You cry over boys you know would never cry about you
He used to light up your room
Now your phone is darker than a tattoo, oh-oh
You move like the Earth around the stars
Broken-hearted when you end up in the same place that you start
No, back to crying over boys you know would never cry about you

But I ran out so
This is the outro yeah
I had a love song for you baby
And my ideas really stood out
Though (For you baby)
But I ran out so
This is the outro yeah
I tried so hard
But life just ain't fair sometimes
That's what I realized
I'm hoping this is just
A blessing in disguise"
341,Beautiful Mistakes,Maroon 5(마룬 파이브),"It's beautiful it's bittersweet
You're like a broken home to me
I take a shot of memories
And black out like an empty street
I fill my days with the way you walk
And fill my nights with broken dreams
I make up lies inside my head
Like one day you'll come back to me
Now I'm not holding on not holding on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holding on not holding on
Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head
She's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake
Makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back
I'm in love with the past
And now we lie awake
Makin' beautiful mistakes
Nah nah nah in my head
Nah nah nah in my bed
Nah nah nah eh
Makin' beautiful mistakes
It's pitiful I can't believe
How every day gets worse for me
I take a break I cut you off
To keep myself from lookin' soft
I fill my nights with the way you was
And still wake up with broken dreams
I make these lies inside my head
Feel like they're my reality
Now I'm not holding on not holding on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holding on not holding on

Nah nah nah in my head
Nah nah nah in my bed
Nah nah nah eh
Makin' beautiful mistakes
You did me wrong 'cause I let you
Usually I like my situations beneficial
Doin' something different
Got me lookin' stupid
The only way I'm comin' back to you is
If you're dreaming lucid
Prove it if you made a promise then keep it
Why you wanna lie and then get mad?
I don't believe it
But really I was doin' just fine without ya
Lookin' fine sippin' wine
Dancin' on club couches
Baby why you wanna lose me
Like you don't need me?
Like I don't block you
And you still try to reach me
How you figure out how to call me
From the TV?
You're runnin' outta chances
And this time I mean it
Yeah bet you miss my love all in your bed
Now you're stressin' out pulling your hair
Smelling your pillows and wishin' I was there
Slidin' down the shower wall lookin' sad
I know it's hard to let go I'm the best
Best you ever had and best you gon' get
And if we break up I don't wanna be friends
You're toxic
Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head
She's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake
Makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back

There is so much that you can share

All the happiness
Don’t even hesitate
Oh, baby, make a brand new start

Once in a while you get so down
Baby, once in a while you feel the doubt

The obstacles that form reality
They are mere illusion
A bigger picture’s waiting here for you
So step back
Into a bright new world
A world of color and harmony 


Taking it slow
Just smell the fragrance in the air
Watch the clouds dance in the sky
Right before your very eyes 

Didn’t you know
That every single blade of grass
Is a miracle?

Don’t even hesitate
Oh, baby, make a brand new start 

Can’t navigate the ups and downs
No you can’t understand the ins and outs

The puzzles that confuse reality
They are mere illusion 
A bigger picture’s waiting here for you

 But you don't think I am

 And I give more than, than I get
 And I'm getting too old for this

 A moment you know that I'm savouring
 'Cause I don't have the patience, we lay there in silence
 Till you get in touch with monogamy

I thought it'd never faze me

Two lovers on the loose
It's all about the way we pace it
Why can't we not simplify?
Just let it go and try
Shall we make shall we make the move?
Shall we make shall we make the move?
Shall we make shall we make the move?
Shall we make shall we make the move?
Photos and the camera never lie
There's nothing on the line to compromise
But I'm still afraid they'll never make it
Trying to cope with what I fantasize
You always find the words to break the ice
It's not like there's much for us
To complicate here
You've been thinking 'bout it too
Two lovers on the loose
It's all about the way we pace it
Why can't we not simplify?
Just let it go and try
Shall we make shall we make the move?
Shall we make shall we make the move?
Shall we make shall we make the move?
Shall we make shall we make the move?
Come close time to do it right
With every step my legs are paralyzed
Can't believe your touch is electrified
With every day it gets intensified
I wanna be fine but god I need you
You're the calm when I try to pull through
Well anyway this feeling feels new
Well anyway this feeling feels new
You've been thinking 'bout it too
Two lovers on the loose
It's all about the way we pace it
Why can't we not simplify?

Yesterdays are made for letting go
Silver will never feel like gold
And chasing shadows will leave you in the cold
Oh you should dance some more
Don't need nobody to take you home
Grab a drink or four
Don't need nobody to take you home
Oh there's a world outside for you to see
It's all beyond the borderline
Two empty souls won't fill the vacancy
You'll never know until you try
Shooting stars were made for you to see
Even clouds could use some company
Swimming in your sky of make believe
It's okay if you're lonely
Shit I get lonely too
Oh you should dance some more
Don't need nobody to take you home
Grab a drink or four
Don't need nobody to take you home
Now the floor is yours
Don't need nobody to call your phone
You better dance some more

When you're around me you make every passing moment new
And when I'm not with you, I know you'll still agree
I'll be the only one to love you in my dreams
Oh my, I swear
I can't stop looking into those eyes
I'm lost, maybe I'm hypnotized
'Cause the way you look with these pink skies
As the sun drifts away tonight
Just hold tight
'Cause when you're in my arms, it feels right
You know there ain't no place I'd rather be
Just dance with me all night

You, you, nothing feels like you, you
No, there ain't no place I'd rather be
Just dance with me all night
'Cause baby nothing else feels like you
I got that feeling like we're young and it's a summer fling
But I've been hurt enough to know I love you differently
I think I finally found someone who won't disagree
I'll be the only one you'll keep loving in your dreams

I can't wait to be home with you
We can sit by the fire feeling cozy and fine
When I'm finally home with you
Feelin' tired of my mind
Of the passing of the time
Many thoughts many lines
Feelin' lost feelin' blind
Every single day wearin' down on my frame
Broken down broken down
I'm broken down again
And I want to believe
The weather won't get to me
But I've been bruised
And I bleed all over everything
I wanna have a little peace
A little rest and relief
I wish I could be like
All the people that I see
But this cursin' of the ground make me
Feel like I can't breathe
'Cause I know I'm not alone
But it do feel like that sometimes
Yea I know I am beloved
But it do be like that sometimes
But I know that it won't be for long
Until I can finally see the throne
Until that time that
When my days are said and done
I'll sing this song
I can't wait to come home to you
I can't wait to be home with you
We can sit by the fire feeling cozy and fine
When I'm finally home with you
I'm really sick of all the nonsense
My body warring with my conscience
And I just wanna feel a little bit of love
In little ways that make me feel okay
I'm so aware of all my broken pieces
Scattered on the ground
I'm singing out of all my silent secrets
Can you hear the sound
I wish I could be like
All the people that I see
But maybe all the people
All around are like me
I know I'm not alone
But it do feel like that sometimes
I know I am beloved
But it do be like that sometimes
I know that it won't be for long
Until I can finally see the throne
Until that time that
When my days are said and done
I'll sing this song
I can't wait to come home to you
I can't wait to be home with you
We can sit by the fire feeling cozy and fine
When I'm finally home with you
I can't wait to come home to you
I can't wait to be home with you
We can sit by the fire feeling cozy and fine
When I'm finally home with you"

 But it helps me breathe
 When I'm alone like a tree

 Doctors, run, come help me quick
 I don't know what it is
 But there is something wrong with me

 Give me more
 I'm sorry now about it
 Give me more
 I'm more than that

 I've got blood and I've got love
 I am so damn happy to be awake
 Shake me up with pills to take
 Tell me why the bellyache

 Give me more
 I'm sorry now about it
 Give me more
 I'm broken down, forget it
 I'd like to be more
 And I want an orange tree

 If in ten days I'm not dead
 I will get on out and use my legs
 Run myself a clear green bath
 Keep the good times rolling
 And that my friends, is that"

I was kind of reckless
'Til I fell in love
Now I call my doctor every day
Since I met you something in me's changed
Second that you called me yours
I had something worth living for
Now I'm scared of planes and heart attacks
If I die I'll never get you back
You made me a hypochondriac
I used to drink like a sailor
If I had a weird pain I'd say a prayer
Used to need an inhaler
Any time I went up a flight of stairs
I'm not sayin' I'm perfect now
But you gave me something to think
About all the time
Glad I made you mine
Now I call my doctor every day
Since I met you something in me's changed

Red fingertips have lost there flame
Theres only darkness in your games
Now were chasing light again
All the words we left unsaid
Are painting heartbreak in my head
Turned the sunshine grey
Every feeling trying to bloom
From pink to red to ocean blue
Lost to winter again
Skys feel empty
And Life gets heavy
When Nothing good is left to save
Where does love go
When two Hearts turn cold
All the colors start to fade
When colors start to fade
Your sparkling shoes only dance to blues
That yellow dress don't fit your mood
Your black and white choose words
That bruise
Left me tangled and confused
All the words we left unsaid
Are painting heartbreak in my head
Turned the sunshine grey
Every feeling trying to bloom

381,T-Shirts (Acoustic),James Smith,"Maybe I can sail and stay afloat
Maybe I can dive but I won't
Cause I can't face the tide alone
Sitting on the edge of windows
Where we used to talk and you'd smoke
But now I'm up here on my own
Boxes full of years in empty rooms
The hardest thing is letting go of you
So you can
Keep my t shirts
For what it's worth
They look better on you anyway
These old photos
I'll keep them close
In case you wanna see them again
Someday
I know we haven't spoken in weeks
It's like we only meet in our sleep
And I can't wait to close my eyes
I found the missing earring you wore
The night you threw me out
And slammed the door
But you won't let me back this time
And now it haunts me
In these empty rooms
The hardest thing is letting go of you
So you can
Keep my t shirts
For what it's worth
They look better on you anyway
These old photos
I'll keep them close
In case you wanna see them again

And if you should miss me don't call me
Don't tell me just leave me alone
Because you cut me wide open
Left teardrops on all my white roses

And dreams and just stay with me?

While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one

Take my hand and my
Heart and soul, I will
Only have these eyes for you
And you know, everything changes but
We'll be strangers if we see this through
You could stay within these walls and bleed
Or just stay with me
Oh lord, now

All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one

I'm stumbling off drunk, getting myself lost
I am so gone, so tell me the way home
I listen to sad songs, singing about love
And where it goes wrong

All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again

And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend

Little boy
can you tell me now
what can I do
to help this world 
it feels like an absolute blur
He said, it’s really simple
just listen to my words
“give live and love
without expectations
and no limitations”

and with those words in my head
everything seemed to change

‘Cause all this time I’ve been blind
Have been selfish all was mine
What are we trying to get a kick out of
when all we need is time and love

Maybe love is all we need
understanding each other’s insecurities
and add some positivity
Maybe we are being ignorant
discovering so much about space
when we should be discovering ourselves

with those words in my head
everything seemed to change

‘Cause all this time I’ve been blind
Have been selfish all was mine
What are we trying to get a kick out of
when all we need is time and love

Ooooh 

‘Cause all this time I’ve been blind
Have been selfish all was mine

And I’ve been trying to do my best
To get around it
Hmm

Feeling you

Feeling you
Feeling you

The salt lamp has stayed on every night since
Water flooded over the floor
And there is a space between us
A universe it’s full of light and
It’s something that we tend to ignore

And I know that wе can have almost everything that’s out thеre
And it doesn’t make a difference
On how this feels within dear

Watchin' a flower bloom
As its features will grow
I mean I never been
One to preach to them folks
I'm just speakin' from experience
My teachings is dope
Learning lessons with my brethren
Joy is quite contagious
Counting blessings on blessings

I was down in the dumps
With my confidence gone
But then my whole life changed
Droppin' prominent songs

When you need something real
Unfortunately
I fell in love with Bad Bad you
Oh I'm good at being Hide my true face
Oh I'm good at being alone
You will someday
Someday you will know
Hope you will someday

They say I'm the lucky one
But it's not true
Cause now I'm alone here"
400,sunny days,Virginia To Vegas(버지니아 투 베가스),"Oh, everybody knows
 February's meant for getting high and staying home
 And when the sky turns dark again
 It always feels like midnight but it's only 4PM

 Long time since I've seen my best friends
 Fun times out there in the west end

 Sunny days in the cold
 Sunny days, sunny days in the cold
 Sometimes all that it takes
 Is one little taste
 Watch the snow melt away
 As the winter changes lanes
 Sunny days, I don't feel so alone
 Sunny days, sunny days in the cold

 Oh, every now and then
 City girls in summer clothes are coming out again
 I want to soak it up before it's gone
 And find someone to hold until the next one comes along

 So long since I've seen my best friends
 Fun times out there in the west end

 Sunny days in the cold
 Sunny days, sunny days in the cold
 Sometimes all that it takes
 Is one little taste
 Watch the snow melt away
 As the winter changes lanes
 Sunny days, I don't feel so alone
 Sunny days, sunny days in the cold

 Sunny days in the cold
 Sunny days, sunny days in the cold
 Sometimes all that it takes
 Is one little taste
 Watch the snow melt away
 As the winter changes lanes
 Sunny days, I don't feel so alone
 Sunny days, sunny days in the cold 
 Sunny days, sunny days in the cold"
401,Lows,Pink Sweat$,"Take your time with this love
Say you're mine forever
'Cause even when I'm at my lowest low
Just know forever I'll be there for you
When you get tired of this wasteland
I'll always open up my door to you
I really hate it when we ain't friends
Can't stand the drama can we just be cool?
A single moment feel like all day
Lookin' in your eyes erase all the pain
I swear that I don't wanna change
I just wanna dream while I'm awake
Take your time with this love
Say you're mine forever
'Cause even when I'm at my lowest low
Just know forever I'll be there for you
Take your time with this love

Sometimes I comb my hair and sometimes I won't 
Depending on how the wind blows 
I might even paint my toes 
It really just depends on whatever feels good in my soul 

I'm not the average girl from your video 
And I ain't built like supermodel 
But I learned to love myself unconditionally 
Because I am a queen 
I'm not the average girl from your video 
My worth is not determined by the price of my clothes 
No matter what I'm wearing I will allways be India Arie 

When I look in the mirror the only one there is me 
Every freckle on my face is where it's supposed to be 
And I know our creator didn't make no mistakes on me 
My feet My thighs My lips My eyes I'm loving what I see 

I'm not the average girl from your video 
And I ain't built like supermodel 
But I learned to love myself unconditionally

I'm not the average girl from your video 
My worth is not determined by the price of my clothes 
No matter what I'm wearing I will allways be India Arie 

Am I less of lady if I don't wear pantyhose 
My mama said a lady ain't what she wears 
but what she knows 
But I've drawn the conclustion it's all an illusion 
Confusions the name of the game 
A misconception a mass deception 
Something's got to change 
Don't be offended this all my opinion 
Ain't nothing that I'm say law 
This is a true confession of a life learned lesson 
I was sent here to share with y'all 
So get in where you fit in 
Go on and shine Clear your mind now's the time 
Put this all on the shelf go on and love yourself 
Cause everything's gonna be alright 

I'm not the average girl from your video 
And I ain't built like supermodel 
But I learned to love myself unconditionally 
Because I am a queen 
I'm not the average girl from your video 
My worth is not determined by the price of my clothes 
No matter what I'm wearing I will allways be India Arie 

Keep your fancy drinks and your expensive minks 
I don't need that to have a good time 
Keep your expensive car and your caviar 
All i need is my guitar 
Keep your Cristal and your pistol 
I'd rather have a pretty piece crystal 
Don't need your silly cone I prefer my own 
What Gog gave me is just fine 

I'm not the average girl from your video 
And I ain't built like supermodel 
But I learned to love myself unconditionally 
Because I am a queen

And you need some love and care
And nothing, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend

If the sky above you
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep your head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at your door

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there, yes, I will

 Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
When people can be so cold?
They'll hurt you and desert you
And take your soul if you let them, don't you let them

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there, yes, I will
You've got a friend

To tell you the truth
I just want you to be happy
But I don't wanna have to see it
Maybe I'll see you in passing
And we can pretend this is easy
Keep my eyes close so you won't know
I'm falling apart hanging onto your ghost
I just want you to be happy
But I don't wanna have to see it
The reality is Hard to admit
But we didn't work well
So please live your life

Time's a finite thing
And so are me and you
Can't say that I'm not glad
To have
Somebody to hold
Someone I know
Will see me through the night
And I don't even have to try
Guess I can't lie

침대에서 내게 말했죠
my minds got deeper

so you say you can’t reach it no more 
당신은 더이상 닿을 수 없다고 했어요

I hate when I have to be there to do stuffs you'd want me to 
난 당신이 원하는 걸 하러 가야 한다는 게 싫어요 
You know I have something to do, Since I wasn’t the girl that you knew
내가 변한 이후로는 당신도 내가 할 일이 있다는 걸 알 텐데
Let’s not talk about that, In front of lives ahead

Can’t say we'll be done well
우리가 잘 끝날 거라고 말할 수 없지만
Don’t say what you want 
당신이 원하는 걸 말하지 마요


I’m not a bird anymore
난 더이상 새가 아니에요
Since you set me free to leave 
당신이 날 자유롭게 놓아준 후로 
My heart wants to fly 
내 마음이 날고 싶어해요
So you can’t grab me no more
당신이 더이상 날 붙잡지 못하도록

I hate when I can’t do the things what my minds want me to do 
내 마음이 내게 원하는 일들을 못한다는 게 싫어요
You use that to save your heart 
당신은 그걸 이용해 당신 마음을 지키죠
Since I am not the girl that you want
난 당신이 원하는 소녀가 아니기에
Don’t let me down again 
또 실망시키지 말아요
and you should play it fair
공평하게 해야죠 
Changes are hurting 
변화는 아프지만
But steady things don’t stay 
변함없는 건 머물지 않아요


Can’t be what you want 
당신이 원하는 게 될 수 없고
I can’t be what you were

Give you something warm
To put around your shoulders when you're cold
And later in the summer take the boat and go skiing
Dry you off when you'd get out the lake
And talk about the houses we'd buy when we're old

That something bad was coming

sometimes i miss those dreamy days
가끔 난 신경쓸 게 없던 날들이 그리워
when i didn’t care, now nothing’s the same

when will i finally feel like
언제쯤 나는 모든 게
everything will be alright?
괜찮아질 거라 느낄까?

And a little bit of mine
There's nothing I can say
To change your mind
So while I got you in your room
Forgive me if it is too soon
But before you walk away
I got a few more things to say
Would it bother you
If I was looking 'round
For somebody else?
Would it bother you
If I was sleeping with someone
And not by myself? ooh
Kiss another girl slowly yeah
While I'm taking my time
If I was doing just fine
Would it bother you bother you?
And baby now you're gone
I can have that bottle of rum
'Cause you're not here to try
And change my mind
Just go ahead and turn the key
Just go ahead and set me free
Baby as you drive away
I only got one thing to say yeah
Would it bother you

Spend all of my money

At hiding all this darkness inside me

All of a sudden I'm there at that gate?
The end of my life no time for goodbyes
And I didn't get to try everything twice
I'd say Why'd it have to be me?
Why'd I have to go like this?
Know we hardly ever speak
But you could've given me notice
So thank God it's all in my head
'Cause I ain't done breathing just yet
I hope I don't go before it's my time
Before I can show what I'll do with my life
My wife would be sad and keep asking why
My mom would be mad
'Cause that's just what she's like
But I hope that someone remembers me well
That my messed up stories
Are good ones to tell
Don't get to decide but if I did
I wouldn't die before I got to live
I wanna know what it's like
To see 91 candles alight
Surrounded by the people who still love me
Even though I've never looked so ugly
It's the end of my life and that's fine
At least I could say my goodbyes
I hope I don't go before it's my time
Before I can show what I'll do with my life
My wife would be sad and keep asking why
My mom would be mad
'Cause that's just what she's like

That my messed up stories are
Good ones to tell

I don't really think that you mind
Build me up and turn me on

426,Thoughts,Michael Carreon(마이클 캐리언),"You and I have been drivin for miles now
it aint no thing we been friends for a awhile now
I love how we kick it and we do it all the time
and I love every minute livit like we both were dyin now
we both said that wed stay friends forever
and everyone asks me when well ever get together
and what I say back
Is that its not like that

I'd rather be your friend
than your nothin at all
thats why I cant tell you
how I really feel
I dont wanna risk it all my thoughts
will remain thoughts

I believe we can be the epitome 
of two in love I believe in possibilities
and were just best friends but the chemistry says to me
that were in love and meant to be
and you might feel the same or the opposite
or you might feel a little or a lot of it
or you might be
waiting for me 

I'd rather be your friend
than your nothin at all
thats why I cant tell you
how I really feel
I dont wanna risk it all my thoughts
will remain thoughts

I seen you at the top and I seen you at the bottom
and it breaks my heart to hear 
you talk about your guys problems
so I keep my options open 
even though my thoughts are broken
and all these thoughts keep pokin 
my emotions I keep hopin
that one day I'll ask you and you ll say “finally”
or maybe one day I'll pass you 
and you wont say hi to me
or lie to me say bye to me 
or tell me that your vibin me
and all of these thoughts keep 
eatin whats inside of me
you sleep on my lap and I sleep on your bed 
and its no big deal to your mom and your dad
cause I stay on my side and you stay on yours
and they know were just friends 
they even let yo close the door
and the more that I'm with you the more that I wanna
go through all the drama and finally tell my momma
that I told her that I love her 
and I know that theres no other
after all they say that 
best friends make the best lovers

I'd rather be your friend
than your nothin at all
thats why I cant tell you
how I really feel
I dont wanna risk it all my thoughts
will remain thoughts

I'd rather be your friend
than your nothin at all
thats why I cant tell you
how I really feel
I dont wanna risk it all my thoughts
will remain thoughts"
427,Something bout That Feeling,Devin Kennedy,"When it feels like 
I've been fading to the background
Don't leave my room for like a week, 
don't wanna go out
But all these moments 
keep me reminding me of just how
Just how you can't have the high's 
without the letdowns
I overcomplicate
I underestimate
How easy it is to live like this
Feel better if I take my time
Just a second and I'll be alright
I know that there's a love that's gonna find me
There's something 'bout that feeling
There's something 'bout that feeling
There's something 'bout that feeling
There's something 'bout that feeling
Outside, the rain's done dancing 
with the storm clouds
But inside, there's not a dry eye 
in this whole house
And it ain't sadness 
why these tears keep falling down now
I know I'm not alone, 
I just get caught up in myself
I overcomplicate
I underestimate
I know that there's a love that's gonna find me
There's something 'bout that feeling
There's something 'bout that feeling
There's something 'bout that feeling
There's something 'bout that feeling
There's something 'bout that feeling
There's something 'bout that feeling
There's something 'bout that feeling
There's something 'bout that feeling"
455,The Shadow of Your Smile,European Jazz Trio(유러피안 재즈 트리오),"The shadow of your smile 
When you have gone
Will color all my dreams 
and light the dawn
Look into my eyes my love and see
All the lovely things you are to me
Our wistful little star was far too high
A teardrop kissed your lips and so did I 
Now when I remember spring
All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering 
The shadow of your smile
Now when I remember spring
All the joys that love can bring
I will be remembering 
The shadow of your smile 
your smile
your smile"

On the streets times' trying

Ooh ooh
Every time you come around
You know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down
I let you take control
I can feel the paradise
Before my world implodes
And tonight I had something wonderful
My bad habits lead to late nights
Endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last
But it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose or use or do
My bad habits lead to
Wide eyes stare into space
And I know I'll lose control
Of the things that I say
Yeah I was lookin' for a way out
Now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two
It's true it's true
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Every pure intention ends
When the good times start
Fallin' over everything
To reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights
And then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last
But it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose or use or do
My bad habits lead to
Wide eyes stare into space
And I know I'll lose control
Of the things that I say
Yeah I was lookin' for a way out
Now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
We took the long way 'round
And burned 'til the fun ran out now
My bad habits lead to late nights, endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last
But it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose or use or do
My bad habits lead to
Wide eyes stare into space
And I know I'll lose control

'Cause you kept my mouth shut

I threw up and I feel fine
You should try it sometime
But who am I to give you advice anymore?

Keep hold of all your tears

Nothing feels better than buying love
When push comes to shove, I'm lonely

Everybody talking 'bout you
Doesn't get you far

Never any good with surprises, compromises

It doesn't matter who you are
Everything is not about you
But if you work hard""

Truth is ugly so you want the beautiful lie
You must be dreaming
Got stars in your eyes
Told you I don't need no body else by my side
You call it cynical
I call it life
I'm not your heroine
This ain't no fairytale
I'm never ever
I'm never ever never ever gonna be Cinderella

I'm never ever
I'm never ever gonna be Cinderella
ADD you know me my heart can't concentrate
Grass is greener on the other side of the gate
I could say i'll never leave you
Babe, I wouldn't cheat you that way
I'm too fickle don't know how to stay in one place
You must be dreaming
Got stars in your eyes
Told you I don't need no body else by my side
You call it cynical
I call it life
I'm not your heroine
This ain't no fairytale
I'm never ever
I'm never ever never ever gonna be Cinderella
I'm never ever
I'm never ever gonna be Cinderella

Never ever ever

Never ever ever

Your too busy fallin'
Your too busy callin'
Been tryna push your love on me like it's a fact
And you hate me cuz I never say it back
I'm never ever
I'm never ever never ever gonna be Cinderella
I'm never ever
I'm never gonna be Cinderella

Never ever ever

Never ever ever

Never ever ever"
505,Real Life,Claire Rosinkranz,"Sleep 'til 12 PM
I hit the snooze on my alarm, let's do it again
Roll out of bed around 1:30, check who I am
‘Cause honestly, I don't remember
My sanity got stuck in December
And my boyfriend doesn't exist
I'm in my hoodie and some sweatpants watching Netflix
Call it romantic with a little bit of a twist
Not gonna lie, don't want a guy ask for the
I'd like a box of breadsticks, eh


It's gonna be alright
Welcome to actual real life
It's gonna be alright
Da-da-da-da


Scrolling through my phone all day
Looking at all these perfect people
You're gorgeous, stop
Oh, my God, bae
And I wonder what would they say if I did nothing to impress them
Would they still be obsessed then?
And my schedule fell through the cracks
Sometimes I get my shit together, but others, I take three or four naps
There's no system, maybe I should get a cool tat
Having dumb conversations with the evil house cat
Yeah, yeah, yeah



It's gonna be alright
Welcome to actual real life
It's gonna be alright

I don't think that you would think that I could really be a pop star
But when I'm in my room, I'm really feeling like a rock star
Every does it, Sarah-Sue said she wasn't
Probably busy looking pretty for her special long lost cousin
What you gonna go when you're 'round like 82
And you're not looking at the past like, “Damn, this life goes really fast""
And all that you can remember's you were trying to be better
All these temporary pleasures, no real memories to treasure
Yeah, yeah, yeah


It's gonna be alright
Welcome to actual real life
It's gonna be alright
It's gonna be alright
Welcome to actual real life
It's gonna be alright

507,Together Lonely (feat. Cehryl),Tim Atlas(팀 아틀라스),"Are you done with your day job
Are you free for the day
I know you cake on the makeup
Cuz you don't wanna face
That you're lost in the patterns
But you paint anyways
Ya i know what your feeling
Cause I’m feeling it too
We’re dancing at the party
They’re filling up the room
But I don’t see nobody
Nobody else but you
We hate the taste of captain
Let’s make it feel brand new
If I’ve done it a thousand times again
i’ll do it with you too
Heard you’re done with the small talk
You'd Rather cut to the chase
Hang your heart in a chapel
But they force you to date
Oh I'll try to be different
If you meet me tonight
We could spill our secrets
And the scripts we can’t rewrite
Done trying to be cool
We're spinning around
Caught in the crowd
Hoping it dies down slowly
And if I step on your feet
I hope you won’t leave
We'll be together lonely"
508,Old Friends,Josh Tobias(조쉬 토비아스),"I don't recognize these faces
And these pictures in my phone
If I could only remember
Where I ended up last night
But this apartment feels so empty
When you're drinking on your own
Isn't this what I always wanted
Then why do I feel so haunted
By those same face
Running through my brain
And I wish I could go back
But I can't just jump in a time machine
So I'll smoke my weed and then I'll just
Pour one out for my old friends
Getting high on the weekends
I know we don't keep in touch
Like we used to
But I keep making these new friends
Why do I try to impress them
Is it cause I'm afraid that
I'm still just like my old friends
Old friends
And if I am what's so wrong with
Being just like my old friends
Old friends
Sometimes I drink my feelings
Till I'm passed out on the floor
It wasn't too long ago
We were laughing through the night
But this bed can feel so empty
When you're sleeping on your own
I should be perfectly happy
So please tell me what is happening
By these same faces
Running through my brain
And I wish I could go back
But it's been too long and the weed's all gone
So I smoke this roach and then I just
Pour one out for my old friends
Getting high on the weekends
I know we don't keep in touch like we used to
But I keep making these new friends
Why do I try to impress them
Is it cause I'm afraid that I'm still
I remember when we stayed out late
Told my mama we'd be home by eight
Then we made a bunch of dumb mistakes
But I wouldn't trade it I wouldn't trade it
When we stayed out late
Told my mama we'd be home by eight

I might have feelings I can't fake
Only lovers put everything at stake
I know you don't love me in this way
What a lovely mess I've made
Too late to be doing things
I shoulda done when you were in the room
I should find it negligent
How you reacted
Can't blame me for tryin'
Thought this would end happily
No use in hidin' from the fact
That I'm not what you need
Oh I might have feelings I can't fake
Only lovers put everything at stake
I know you don't love me in this way
What a lovely mess I've made
When did I get so uptight
'Bout every little thing?
You get that too?

Worth the time, you know I'll wait
For you
For you, hm-mmh-mmh
I brush it off like I'm okay, I
Dream about what I would say
To you
If you knew

I'm walkin' home on sidewalks
Hoping one day you'd watch
You were never there
There

You're sweet like cherry wine
Somethin' so divine
I can't get enough of you
I wish you were mine
Sweet like cherry wine
Somethin' so divine
I can't get enough of you
I wish you were mine

I can't talk to you
But I can't just be friends
It's another Saturday
And I'm on my own again
If you want honesty
Lately it's been hard to sleep
It's a nightmare
When you're not here

You
I bet you don't know what it's like
Waitin' for you on the sidelines
Keepin' everything inside

You're sweet like cherry wine
Somethin' so divine
I can't get enough of you
I wish you were mine
Sweet like cherry wine
Somethin' so divine
I can't get enough of you
I wish you were mine

Roses bloomed and autumn faded
You talked to me, said you were
Chasin', too
Like you knew, everything I'd
Been goin' through like you were there, when
I'd look away and you would stare
At me
Can't believe

You're sweet like cherry wine
Somethin' so divine
I can't get enough of you
Even if I tried
Sweet like cherry wine
Somethin' so divine
I can't get enough of you
Even if I tried"
512,After All...,Cardigans(카디건스),"after all you were perfectly right
but I'm scaring close to insanity
and on a night like this
nothing stays the same
nothing looks the same

after all you were perfectly right
though our relation just split me in two
and on a night like this
pieces fall apart
visions fall apart

after all you were perfectly right
I have never been happy before
and on a night like this
you can hear the words
see behind the words

after all you were perfectly wrong
though I thought I'd found love
and on a night like this
nothing could be worse
nothing could be worse"
513,Darkroom,Ten Sleep,"You're made of the places
That have affected you
You carry them with
They're printed on the blank of the canvas
On the back of your mind
Who are you inside red rooms
You untie a face to choose
Love to try on
Who you are without dark rooms
Too young to lose it
Bored of collecting years
Putting your foot in
Rub your eyes capture the memories
Don't lose the pieces
Who are you inside red rooms
You untie a face to choose
Love to try on who you are
Without dark rooms"
515,sad girl,Alaina Castillo,"I watched the sunrise today
Chasing the moon on its way
Blood orange flooding the bay
Oh what a fruitless escape
Wishful thinking I could push the dark aside
Overthinking lines holding back replies
Reading all their lies
Thinking that they're right
Gotta stop  gotta stop gotta stop caring
I know you're probably hurting
The way that I'm hurting
We're both the same
Need someone to blame
Do you search just to see me
And hope I'm unhappy to ease the pain?
An easy escape
I know it's not your fault
'Cause you're a sad girl just like me
Say you don't care what they say
But you bottle it up anyway
Save it for a rainy day
So the sad hours won't go away
Wishful thinking I could push the dark aside
Overthinking lines holding back replies
Reading all their lies
Thinking that they're right
Gotta stop gotta stop gotta stop caring
I know you're probably hurting
The way that I'm hurting
We're both the same
Need someone to blame
Do you search just to see me
And hope I'm unhappy to ease the pain?
An easy escape
I know it's not your fault
'Cause you're a sad girl just like me
Am I wrong? Sometimes I get it wrong
Maybe you're jealous you think that I've won
But I know if only you knew
The hate in your words you'd hate them too
'Cause I know that you're probably hurting
The way that I'm hurting
We're both the same
Need someone to blame
Do you search just to see me
And hope I'm unhappy to ease the pain?

516,first,mxmtoon,"I think we saw it comin'
It wasn't hard to see
The time we had together
Was over, we agree
But I have no regrets
Just strange to sit and think
You spend your time with someone else
And then they're gone within a blink

It's odd that I can write these songs
Never knowin' right from wrong
But when I finally found
That my heart could pound
The chapter seemed to end
I can't believe you've come and gone
And you think your future's long
But there was just no way
Nothing wе could say
The chapter has to end

I still know I am thankful
For еverything, you've done
Although it wasn't easy
I'm proud we gave it a run
The first of many lessons
That I will undergo
Our journeys will diverge here
And we'll learn from what we know

But it's so odd that I can write these songs
Never knowin' right from wrong
But when I finally found
That my heart could pound
The chapter seemed to end
And I can't believe you've come and gone
When you think your future's long

Nothing we could say

Kicking rocks in the promised land

It kills me to see how he treats you this way
Nobody else will so I gotta say
I don't really like your boyfriend (Nope)
I don't really like your boyfriend
Here's a solid reason why he's actually the worst
You can't get trashed at a party 
without checking with him first
And he says it's cause he's worried 
cause the world is filled with creeps
But he's really just projecting 
his own insecurities yeah

사랑 그것은 알 수 없는 너의 그리움
남아있는 나의 깊은 미련들

사실 그때도 알고 있었던 
그 터질듯한 감정 난 아직 까지도
이 손가락 끝이 찌릿할만큼 못 잊었어
결국엔 입을 떼지 못 했지 단 한 마디도
니가 오는 길을 알고 있기에 
일부로 엇갈린 길을 따라서 걷던 발 
넌 아마 몰랐겠지
다행이야 내가 본 게 뒷 모습이어서
그게 기억되는 너의 마지막 모습이어서

차가운 내 맘에 남은 너의 뒷모습
열린 문틈으로 넌 내게 다가올 것 같아
한참을 멍하니 바라보다 
아침햇살에 눈을 뜨고 말았네
사랑 그것은 엇갈린 너와 나의 시간들
스산한 바람처럼 지나쳐갔네
사랑 그것은 알 수 없는 너의 그리움
남아있는 나의 깊은 미련들

다시 올 수 없는 시간들"

익숙할 순 없는 거잖아
아른거리는 순간들을
떠올려봐 다시 설렐 수 있게

아무도 그 누구도 
완벽할 수는 없는 거잖아
두근거렸던 기억들을
떠올려봐 다시 빛날 수 있게

가끔은 아프고 조금은 어색해도
한걸음씩 시작해 말론 못할 어떤 설레임으로

처음엔 몰랐어
어떤 의미인지 
뭘 어떻게 해야하는지.. 

고민하지 말고 먼저 다가서서 보여줘
설레는 그 마음을..

가끔은 아프고 조금은 어색해도
한걸음씩 시작해 말론 못할 어떤 설레임으로

가끔은 아프고 조금 어색해도
서두르지마 괜찮아
바래왔던 것만큼 되지 않아도
기다려 보는거야 
어떤 설레임으로..

가끔은 아프고 조금은 어색해도
한걸음씩 시작해 말론 못할 어떤 설레임으로"

문득 느껴져 아주 두려웠던 순간

그게 어떤 마음인지
그리움 혹은 미움 일까

어떤 날엔 그런 날 있어
무엇인지 모를 낯선

어떤 향기로부터
어떤 날엔 소리로부터
아주 오래된 기억을 느껴

Slowly Bloom In My Heart
까마득했던 기억이 선명해져 갈 수록
Love Blooms In My Heart
알 수 없는 마음을 느껴

손을 대면 느낄 수 있는 이
저릿하게 아픈 이유는 뭔지

기억 하고 싶어서
자꾸 네게로 걷는 나
한발 한발을 너를 따라서

Slowly Bloom In My Heart
까마득했던 기억이 마침 눈을 뜬 순간
I Run To Your Heart
가장 아름답던 순간으로

어느 꿈에
어디 인지 모를 그 공간 속을
헤매고 있을 때

내가 이렇게 아프고
자꾸 눈물 나던 그 모습이
햇살에 비친다

Slowly Bloom In My Heart
까마득했던 기억이 마침 눈을 뜬 순간
I Run To Your Heart

우리의 사랑이 시작되고 그대 손 마주잡고
함께한다면 이 세상 어떤 것이라도
견뎌내리라 나 약속하겠소

Maybe there's a cocoon around the world
And we're all dying just to break through
Cause we'll be butterflies butterflies

I meditate to metamorphosize
I needed change I shifted paradigms
Go to hawaii get a whole new life
Cause I feel the breeze just like a second wind
Underneath my wings and I'm alive again
Seeing everything through a new lens
Maybe we're just butterflies butterflies

That body in a t-shirt

Damn baby, damn baby

Damn baby, it's a type of way you make me feel everyday

I'm writing songs 'bout you on the back of a plane

Never been so happy to get back to LA

Thunder and lightning, darling, it's frightening

Best day with ex-lovers worst than us fighting

Like you turned up the brightness

Didn't even know it was dark before

Baby, before I met you, I slept in bedrooms

Got drunk with my friends, gave lots of tattoos

Now I only want you

So sublime, so true

She keep me like a summer cool breeze

Make me feel fine

Just sipping on that one puff, two drinks

Weight off my mind

That heart a piece of artwork

That body in a t-shirt

My lips speaking these words, man

Damn baby, damn baby

Went from ""hello, "" to ""I never wanna say goodbye""

Went from ""what's your name?"" to ""I couldn't forget if I tried""

If I could do it all again, I would do it all again

Just to do it all again and not change a single thing

Baby, before I met you, I slept in bedrooms

Got drunk with my friends, gave lots of tattoos

Now I only want you

이제 그만 깨어나요 baby good morning
반쯤 감긴 두 눈에 키스해 셀 수 없이
봐왔지만 여전히 새로운 너지
너무 따뜻해 깍지 낀 두 손이
손가락에 화려한 반지 하나 없지만
우린 그 어떤 연인들보다 더 빛나
마주보며 같이 숨 쉬는 것에 행복해서
이런 날들이 평생 계속 됐으면 하고
몰래 기도해 익숙한 아침의 서늘함이
우릴 더 끌어안게 만들어 나른하지
내 발 위에서 함께 추는 왈츠
둘만의 의식처럼 서로를 느낀 후 달콤한 입맞춤

Sweetest love babe
작은 캔디보다 달콤한 그대
You make me feel high
장난치듯 내 입술에 입 맞출 때
Feel good, feel good

조금 더 가까이 와 널 안을 수 있도록
너의 온기로 내 가슴 채울 수 있도록
행복하기만 해 불안하게 떨리던
내 마음에 이제는 평온함이 느껴지고
누군가의 반이 되어 간다는 걸
실감해 너와 내가 느껴
더 깊게 깊게 널 파고들고 싶어
물론 니가 허락하는데 까지만 그러기로
할게 서로 더 좋아질 만큼만
멈추라면 멈추고 더 가라면 가
니 손에 내 어깨 뒤쪽에 
내 입술은 내가 못 가진 미소 그 밑쪽에

Sweetest love babe
작은 캔디보다 달콤한 그대
You make me feel high
장난치듯 내 입술에 입 맞출 때
Feel good, feel good

내 품 위에서 포근하게 잠이 든 너
날 감싸며 등에 딱 붙어있는 너
너의 머리카락을 쓸어 넘기며 
너에게 키스, I love your lips without lipstick
Come close to me, baby
come close to me, uh
I'll give it to you all I'll give it to you all
take my hand, I love you all
Kiss me darling, kiss me darling
너의 작은 이마에 입술을 맞대고
Hold me darling, hold me darling
너를 느낄래 설레는 마음 그대로
Kiss me darling, kiss me darling
너한테는 아무것도 아끼지 않아
Hold me darling
내 손 잡아 (Hold me darling)
my love, by my side

나도 몰래 자꾸 웃고 있죠 사랑인가요
그런 건가요

왠지 그대 맘을 알 수 있죠 느껴지나요
나와 같나요
Under the moonlight
깊어지는 우리 얘긴
짙어지는 이 밤 끝에 닿겠죠
Over the moonlight
그댈 향한 나의 맘이
차오르는 저 달까지 비추죠
화려하지 않은 나에게도
특별 할 것 없는 하루에도 그댄 내게로
불어 오네요
함께 하는 모든 순간들이
잊지 못할 그런 장면으로 기억되겠죠
눈을 감아도
Under the moonlight
깊어지는 우리 얘긴
짙어지는 이 밤 끝에 닿겠죠
Over the moonlight
그댈 향한 나의 맘이
차오르는 저 달까지 비추죠
모든 게 영원하진 않아도
모든 순간들이 빛나고
내 하루 끝에 그대가 있죠
Under the moonlight
나를 불러주는 그대
꿈이라면 깨지 않길 바라죠
Over the moonlight
끝이 없는 나의 맘이
그대에게 전해지길 원하죠"

What is rare only rarely lasts forever
And there's no place like home
Like this place that we've found together
And so it is
So I won't resist
We'll only miss violets till the roses grow
Well I dare not defy
This world that comes and goes
But I'd rather you stay
And these words couldn't hold
Who you are or what you mean to me
For the moment I know
There's nothing quite like you to me
So be free
But be mine
And with time I've come to find
My greed just might be the end of me
How lovely you are
Well I know what remains
And I've wondered this forever
If that truth stays the same
Let's be true you and I"

Someone who I can talk to about everything on my mind
Someone who needs me, trusts me and believes me

You and I predictably knew that we’re meant to be
Together when we bump into each other for the second time (second step)
Didn’t know what to say, so nervous, but curious from the bottom to the top

Waiting for me, in front of me, smiling at me, driving me crazy

And she finds herself a smile
Recognize the little stars
Sparkling up her little sky
Summer evening in July
Every second so divine
Get a little lost in time
Staying up until sunrise
You gotta get up
Now I hold your hands in mine
As you walk here by my side
Watch you shine just like a star
I could do this all the time
Wishes on my Valentine
Always got you on my mind
Sweeter than a lullaby
Would you stay another while
You gotta get up

Sometimes we cried and
Sometimes we lost it

Nothing
Did you say it all means nothing?

I thought that you felt the same way
that makes me feel helpless
I’m so stupid

Tell me that was a joke
My only hope
My weakened heart tells me that im suffering
Broken heart?syndrome
And that tears me to pieces (to pieces)

Since 2016 we were stuck together 
crazy 'bout ’Notebook’ 
but didn't know about love
Always you're pissed off
Always you break my heart
Always you run away

And we miss our mothers again
She don't really like you
But I kind of like you
You don't really like to mention that to me
Tell em right a haiku cuz
No one really likes me
I'm getting used to that
Days by baby I don't got no brake lights
My car turns off when I go fast
Why would you want me
Days by baby I don't got no brake lights
My car turns off when I go fast
Why would you want me
Days by I'm using the sun rise
I'll fall close to you

Into my brain
You come around needing closure
The pain and the passion

To get you off my mind
Feel like I touched the moon
Trying to find me something new
There ain't a thing I wouldn't do
To get you off my mind
Just when I thought I could manage
To keep a balance
I'm on the ground
You've always had the advantage
Of being callous
No longer bound

Driving down the avenue

592,Hypnotized,Weston Estate,"[Verse 1: Marco Luka, tanu, Marco Luka & tanu]
I was young when I met you from the jump
Never scared of being honest, where's the fun?
I'm lying to you baby, I would rather run
Than let you down because I knew you were the one

You're too good, you see?
You got me rolling on the ground the way you look at me
And I've been trying to take you out just like I do in my dreams
Baby, girl
Maybe, girl, let me know

In the drop top we will just get high
In the nighttime we will live our lives
In the nighttime that's when I got by
In the nighttime, in the nighttime

[Hook]
When you cry it’s bringing out your eyes
I've been so inclined to sympathize
Swear to God you got me hypnotized
I, I swear
Who's the guy for you if it's not I?
Thought I told you I can't live a lie
Swear to God you got me hypnotized
I, I



[Verse 2: tanu & Marco Luka]
Until we meet again
The world might really end
Can we be more than friends?
Can we just not pretend?

Baby I know you're just scared
But I'm hoping you're right there
Way you make me feel's not fair
He's knocking on your door now
She's walking all alone, now
Swear to God if you do not go
Then imma have to do some things I never done before

[Hook: Marco Luka]
When you cry it’s bringing out your eyes
I've been so inclined to sympathize

Swear to God you got me hypnotized

I want
Is for you to be right by my side
You've been traveling through my state of mind
All

Is for you to be right by my side
Baby girl, why don't you spend the night?

593,Something bout That Feeling,Devin Kennedy,"When it feels like 
I've been fading to the background
Don't leave my room for like a week, 
don't wanna go out
But all these moments 
keep me reminding me of just how
Just how you can't have the high's 
without the letdowns
I overcomplicate
I underestimate
How easy it is to live like this
Feel better if I take my time
Just a second and I'll be alright
I know that there's a love that's gonna find me
There's something 'bout that feeling
There's something 'bout that feeling
There's something 'bout that feeling
There's something 'bout that feeling
Outside, the rain's done dancing 
with the storm clouds
But inside, there's not a dry eye 
in this whole house
And it ain't sadness 
why these tears keep falling down now
I know I'm not alone, 
I just get caught up in myself
I overcomplicate
I underestimate
I know that there's a love that's gonna find me
There's something 'bout that feeling
There's something 'bout that feeling
There's something 'bout that feeling
There's something 'bout that feeling
There's something 'bout that feeling
There's something 'bout that feeling
There's something 'bout that feeling
There's something 'bout that feeling"
594,Every Second,Mina Okabe,"Every second every day
I spend hoping we never change love when you
Never wait or hesitate
To tell me what is on your mind really do
Enjoy your company I think you would agree
Just where you'd rather be is right here with me
Make my day in every way
Know I'll be ok when you are around
I just want to stop
Worrying 'bout what could come
I really like it here in your arms
Thinking this is where I belong
I had no doubt in my mind we would make it far
Now I fear a change want time to stop
Waiting for an argument
Inevitable but don't know how bad
The smallest things will get to you
Hoping we won't be a thing of the past
But where we are today is where I want to stay
Leave worries far away when you're here with me
I should just enjoy this time
In case we end up leaving all this behind
I just need to stop
Worrying 'bout what could come
I really like it here in your arms
Thinking this is where I belong
I had no doubt in my mind we would make it far
Now I fear a change want time to stop
Yeah I'm always with you
I wanna remember this moment in time
Though I'm always with you
I wanna remember if we leave this behind
I really like it here in your arms
Thinking this is where I belong
I had no doubt in my mind we would make it far
Now I fear a change want time to stop
I really like it here in your arms
Thinking this is where I belong
I had no doubt in my mind we would make it far
Now I fear a change want time to stop
(Yeah I'm always with you)
I wanna remember this moment in time
(Though I'm always with you)
I wanna remember if we leave this behind

I wanna remember if we leave this behind"
597,Damn Bean,John-Robert,"Ran into the rain 'til my knees they
Buckled when I hit the concrete
Centralize the pain within these legs
You treat me like a friend not a lover
Fearing there's more to discover
And I wish I told you sooner
The things that I felt
But she found somebody else
And I'm alone with love songs to
Myself
And I wish she knew
All the things that I would do
But she's dancing alone with someone new
And it's almost like you're dead
And your ghost it
Lingers in my head it wanders
Aimlessly to corners I wish to forget
Like memories of late nights and red wine
Like the way your body glistened in moonlight
And the promises we made but never kept
But she found somebody else
And I'm alone with love songs to
Myself
And I wish she knew
All the things that I would do
But she's dancing alone with someone new
But she found somebody else
Ooo lalalala ooo lalalala
But she found somebody else
And I'm alone with love songs to
Myself
And I wish she knew
All the things that I would do
But she's dancing alone with someone new"

601,don't miss me,Claire Rosinkranz,"Feeling kinda nervous
 Starting things not really like me
 Got a boyfriend says he likes me
 Guess I like him but it's funny
 Cause I'm not big on relationships
 I'm more down for the flirt
 All my friends say it's a problem
 Nah, I just rather not get hurt

 Cause I can't take my feelings
 And I can't trust my heart
 So I never take my chances
 Cause I know I'll break apart

 I hate the mushy shit and
 I tell it how it is and
 I wish that I was kidding
 But I'm not good at listening
 So I don't want someone missing me

 I'm so unpredictable
 One day I'm irresistible
 The next I hate myself
 Never good for someone else

 So I try to stay away
 Don't want them dealing with my brain
 But suddenly he's got me folding
 Cause I only want him to hold me, yuck

 But I can't take my feelings
 And I can't trust my heart
 So I never take my chances
 Cause I know I'll break apart

 I hate the mushy shit and
 I tell it how it is and
 I wish that I was kidding
 But I'm not good at listening
 So I don't want someone missing me

And that's a ballerina bar

And you can't call my bluff when I roll the dice

And got no plan B

I think my friends think I'm gambling
And are wondering when I'm gonna grow up
If I'm gonna get a job
And a fully chiseled bod
And stop putting all my faith in luck
Be happy with the basics
And enjoy my small drink and fries
Making work for myself
Tryna be a better guy
But I'm a bit broke

Woke up and I bumped my head
Stubbed my toe on the edge of the bed
Opened the fridge and the food all gone
Neighbor damn dog done crapped on my lawn
Hopped in the car and the car won't start
It's too damn hot but I still gotta walk
Behind an old lady in the grocery line
Praying that my card don't get declined

Oh damn oh damn oh damn oh damn
Oh man oh man oh man oh man
Oh damn oh man oh damn oh man

Aint gonna stop cause they tell me so
Cause 99 miles per hour baby,
Is how fast that I like to go

Too quick for the lines they throw
I walk to the sound of my own drum,
It goes, they go, we go, hey yeah yeah yeah

Oh, here we go
Feel it in my soul
Really need it, need it, so go
Gotta feel it, body takes control
Really need it, need it

I wake up to the city of angels
To see my name headlining the coast
They say I'm a walking dreamer, baby
If I stop they would make the show

Can't keep up with my rhythm

Too quick for the lines they throw
I walk to the sound of my own drum,

This isn't how I planned it

I guess I lost control

I wanna feel 17 forever

So let the good times roll

Let's try to remember 

we can do it all over again

You got me feelin' so wasted

Parties in the basement

Graduation weekend

I wish it'd never end

Cold night back seat

We made our own heat

We had some good times

We had some good times

Sneaking out Friday night

Never felt so alive

Always said we're so poor

We've never had more

Stop time hit rewind

Hit rewind

I wanna runaway

Forget everyone I know

Stuck in a day job

Living all alone

I wanna feel seventeen forever

So let the good times roll

we can do it all over again

Much more to come

While we are still young

Tattooed up on their shoulders

Shall I give it all together
But enough is enough
They say we're too young for love
But I'm catching feelings, catching feelings

In my head we're already together
I'm cool alone, but with you I'm better
I just wanna see you smile
You say the word and I'll be right there
I ain't never going nowhere

I'm just trying to see where this can take us
Cause everything about you girl is so contagious
I think I finally got it done
Now it's left to do now, lets get out the mirror
And say it to her

Or should I moving closer just be still
How would I know?

Will everything change?
How do I know, if she feels the same?

Oh the way she says my name
And there's no escaping
Or no complications
I know she does it on purpose
And if I let her go I'll be insane
I'm all out of questions
All the silence all the takes
And it paints a perfect picture
For we all 'cause we're the same

And knew exactly what I was thinking
And I know that you're dangerous

Could this be a strange new love I've got
Plus she's always got that loud pack
Inspiration for this soundtrack
Every time she throws that ass back
All she says is
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
Every time I go inside of your protected
Place with reverence
I'm reminded of a time I was neglected
It seems you're heaven sent
She loves to top me off
She's cut from the finest cloth my love
Plus we like to take it easy
All she wants to do is please me
Every time I'm on that TV calls me up says
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away

Just passing by

We need to look around
Something's changed
We're gonna find
A bit funner surround
So stop with a deep breath
The small things
Will make the world shine
It's just an ordinary day
But so special
So before the dark so dense
We talk slow
Tomorrow how will it be?
We could say I love you
But the silence loves us
How to say I'm sorry
No words won't appear
A coffee in the gentle
Morning light
Salty chips
When so alone at night
Feelin like it's a bit of
Something new
Babies smile like blooms
In spring
Birds tweet like singing queens
It looks brighter surround
So stop with a deep breath
The small things
Will make the world shine

Feeling this vibe different
Got a firework face

Getting over the obstacle of you
And we're too young for growing older
I need somebody new
And now I see that you were
Colder than any winter flu
But I'm over you
Oh girl your sugar turns so bitter now
Like bubblegum stale in my mouth
I hate the taste
And though I tried my best to spit you out
You're still in my blood you stick around
I hate the taste
Wanted love I wanted love
But never wanted to learn
I built you up built you up
You tore me down in return
Oh I've been told I should be
Getting over the obstacle of you
And we're too young for growing older
I need somebody new
And now I see that you were
Colder than any winter flu
But I'm over you

Like bubblegum stale in my mouth

And though I tried my best to spit you out
You're still in my blood you stick around
I hate the taste
Wish I could spit you out my mind
Leave you and all your shit behind
Wish I could spit you out my mind

Or did we mean it?

Hanging up the lights
With the intensity and strife
Of your avoidance like a knife
In my cotton candy side
I'm hoping for a fight
In this imaginary vibe
That I have caught and totemized
To replace you when you hide
So did we kiss 'cause it was dark?
Or did we mean it?

To keep believing
You were temporary talk
To last just for a season

Or not black no more
I ate yellow turpentine
They call me yellow bone
This stupid small city got me
Writing sad songs
I'm living in color and I taste it
I don't ever waste it
Been ducking and dodging bullets
Like I'm in the matrix
Then I ate the blue and red pill
That purple got me wasted
It got me wasted slow mo
Aye oh no
I wish my life can go slow mo
My life is on the go
Slow mo I wish my life can go slow mo
I just want the pain to go

Just know I love you all till I'm gone
Till I'm gone
For now I guess we gotta deal
With the mumble rap crap
Talking bout smoking loud
But they can't afford a snapback
Imma keep painting over the fact that
My emotions don't show I paint I paint
The colors got me feeling
Some way some way

Ain't no one to tell you ""run, boy, run
Like I should've done""
Oh, when I can't fight the bloodline
Living in the seams back home
Oh, no

How am I gonna know
If I'm never alone?
When I live in the numb
And all feeling is gone?

I throw it all out the window
All out the window
Like it's all I'll ever be

The halls are closing in
If I knew from the start
Would it change a thing?"
702,love won't,Gavriel,"It's been about a month
Since you’ve been outside
You say you’ve got no energy
You tell me you need love
Just to try to get by
But man you’re not convincing me
Say you needa heal still
But what’s enough time
Gotta go outside to breathe
And it’s been about a month
Since you’ve been outside
And your mind just can’t get over
changing too fast
But you’ll make it through
to see the light at last

Love won’t stop the pain
Make your nights turn into days
All your problems rearrange
Love won’t stop the pain
So put down the phone
You gotta go through this alone
You think she’ll change your life
I promise she won’t

Love can’t be a crutch
That’ll make you alright
Sorry to break it to you
It won’t be who you love
That’ll make you alright
And your mind just can’t get over
changing too fast
But you’ll make it through
to see the light at last

No love won’t stop the pain
Make your nights turn into days
All your problems rearrange
Love won’t stop the pain
So put down the phone
You gotta go through this alone
You think she’ll change your life
I promise she won’t
Oh
Oh

Love won’t stop the pain
Make your nights turn into days
All your problems rearrange
Love won’t stop the pain
So put down the phone
You gotta go through this alone


You think she’ll change your life
I promise she won’t...
You think she’ll change your life
I promise she won’t
You think she’ll change your life

몰래 동그라미 그려놨던 달력 위 숫자 어느덧 내일
제일 맘에 드는 옷 펼쳐놓고서 넌 어떤 표정일까 나 생각해

해맑은 아이 같은 그대의 눈동자 그 미소가 
자꾸 밟혀서 눈에 선해 한숨만 웃음만 
그대 힘겨운 하루의 끝 이젠 누가 지킬까 누가 위로할까

내 턱끝까지 숨이 차올라 내 머리 위로 바람이 불어온다
온 힘을 다해 나는 달려간다 이게 마지막 선물이 될지도 몰라

눈물이 흘러 아니 내 얼굴 가득히 흐르는 땀방울
늘 그랬듯이 아무렇지 않게 웃으며 안녕 나의 사랑 그대 미안해 (안녕)

하루에도 몇 번씩 나눴던 잘잤어 보고싶다는 인사
그리울 때면 꺼내볼 수 있게 하나하나 내 마음에 담곤해

해맑은 아이 같은 그대의 눈동자 그 미소가 
자꾸 밟혀서 눈에 선해 한숨만 웃음만 
그대 힘겨운 하루의 끝 이젠 누가 지킬까 누가 위로할까

내 턱끝까지 숨이 차올라 내 머리 위로 바람이 불어온다
온 힘을 다해 나는 달려간다 이게 마지막 선물이 될지도 몰라

어떻게 어떻게 그대없는 내일 아침은 (난 겁이 나요)
수많은 밤들 견딜 수 있을까 (웃으며 안녕)

길 건너 멀리 니가 보인다 지루했나봐 발끝만 바라보네
온 힘을 다해 나는 달려간다 이제 마지막 인사가 될지도 몰라

눈물이 흘러 아니 내 얼굴 가득히 흐르는 땀방울

715,눈감아줄께,블락비(Block B),"좋아보여 니 밝은모습과
주위에 들려오는 소식 까지 다
맘같아선 널 붙잡고 싶지만
웃는얼굴에 침을 뱉을수는 없잖아

여전해 그 미소 누구든 보면 빠질것 같은 눈웃음
지금은 내 옆엔 없지만 
일방적인 널 향한 사랑보다 
지켜보는게 나는 훨씬 행복한걸

다시 돌아와 말하려하다
곰곰히 더 생각해보면 오반가

OH MY GOD 속탄다 자꾸 속탄다
하루하루 더늘어만 가는 술병나발 OH BABY

YE GIRL IT'S OKAY 이젠 익숙해
너만좋다면야 나 나 눈감아줄께

YE GIRL IT'S OKAY 이젠 익숙해
너만좋다면야 나 나 눈감아줄께

잠시겠지 아주 잠시겠지
솔로인 친구놈들이 반기겠지
못갔던 온갖 모임에가 달리겠지
그러다 다시 니생각에 잠기겠지

오해말아 정리한거 맞아
오히려 니 연락을 멀리한건 나야
보기보다 나 남자다워서
너만 좋다면야 잡을 맘없어

다시 돌아와 말하려하다
곰곰히 더 생각해보면 오반가

OH MY GOD 속탄다 자꾸 속탄다
하루하루 더늘어만 가는 술병나발 OH BABY

담아낸 나의 진심에
선명해져 somethin' bout you

Yeah 나를 많이 닮은 듯 다른
넌 혹시 나와 같을까 지금
괜한 기대를 해

하루 한 달 일 년쯤 되면
서로 다른 일상을 살아가

나는 아니야
쉽지 않을 것 같아
여전하게도 넌 내 하루하루를 채우고
아직은 아니야
바보처럼 되뇌는 나
입가에 맴도는 말을 삼킬 수 없어
It’s not fine
Ah Ah Ah Ah It’s not fine

머릴 질끈 묶은 채
어지러운 방을 정리해
찾고 있어 somethin' new

가끔 이렇게 감당할 수 없는
뭐라도 해야 할 것만 같은 기분에
괜히 움직이곤 해

하루 한 달 일 년 그쯤이면
웃으며 추억할 거라 했지만

나는 아니야
쉽지 않을 것 같아
여전하게도 넌 내 하루하루를 채우고
아직은 아니야
바보처럼 되뇌는 나
입가에 맴도는 말을 삼킬 수 없어
It’s not fine
Ah Ah Ah Ah It’s not fine

의미 없는 농담, 주고받는 대화
사람들 틈에 난 아무렇지 않아 보여
무딘 척 웃음을 지어 보이며
너란 그늘을 애써 외면해보지만

우리 마지막
그 순간이 자꾸 떠올라
잘 지내란 말이 전부였던 담담한 이별
아직은 아니야
바보처럼 되뇌는 그 말
입가에 맴도는 말을 삼킬 수 없어

Ah Ah Ah It’s not fine"

749,Dans Mon Ile,Lisa Ono(리사 오노/小野リサ),"Dans mon ile 
Ah comme on est bien 
Dans mon ile 
On n'fait jamais rien 
On se dore au soleil 
Qui nous caresse 
Et l'on paresse 

Sans songer a demain 
Dans mon ile 
Ah comme il fait doux 
Bien tranquille 
Pres de ma doudou 
Sous les grands cocotiers qui se balancent 
En silence, nous revons de nous 

Ses yeux brillent 
Et ses cheveux bruns 
S'eparpillent 
Sur le sable fin 
Et nous jouons au jeu d'Adam et Eve 
Jeu facile 
Qu'ils nous ont appris 
Dans mon ile c'est le Paradis"
750,More (Album Version),Matt Dusk(매트 더스크),"More than the greatest love the world has known 
This is the love I give to you alone 
More than the simple words I try to say 
I only live to love you more each day 
 
More than you'll ever know 
my arms long to hold you so 
My life will be in your keeping, 
waking, sleeping, laughing, weeping 
 
Longer than always is a long, long time 
But far beyond forever you'll be mine 
I know I've never lived before 
And my heart is very sure 
No one else could love you more 
 
More than you'll ever know 
my arms long to hold you so 
My life will be in your keeping, 
waking, sleeping, laughing, weeping 
 
Longer than always is a long, long time 
But far beyond forever you'll be mine 
I know I've never lived before

No one else could love you more 
No one else could love you more 
Love you more."
753,Salad Days,Mac Demarco(맥 드마르코)CONNECT 아티스트,"As I’m getting older, chip up on my shoulder
Rolling through life, to roll over and die

Missing hippy Jon, salad days are gone
Remembering things just to tell ‘em so long

Oh mama, actin’ like my life’s already over
Oh dear, act your age and try another year

Always feeling tired, smiling when required
Write another year off and kindly resign

Salad days are gone, missing hippy Jon
Remembering things just to tell ‘em so long

Oh mama, actin’ like my life’s already over
Oh dear, act your age and try another year 
Oh mama, actin’ like my life’s already over

754,Sunflower,Rex Orange County(렉스 오렌지 카운티)CONNECT 아티스트,"I want to know
Where I can go
When you're not around
And I'm feeling down
So won't you stay for a moment
So I can say
I I need you so
Cause right now you know that nothing is new
And I'm obsessed with you
Then I fell to the ground
And you smile at me instead

I don't wanna see you crying
You don't have to feel this emptiness
She said I love you till the day that I die
Maybe she's right
Cause I don't wanna feel like I'm not me
And to be honest I don't even know why
I let myself get down in the first place

I'm trying to keep my mind at bay
Sunflowers still grows at night
Waiting for a minute 
till the sun's seen through my eyes
Make it down down dododown
Make it dodown du du du
Waiting for a minute 
till the sun's seen through my eyes

You know you need to get yourself 
to sleep and dream
And dream of you and I
There's no need to keep an open eye
I promise I'm the one for you
Just let me hold you in these arms tonight
I'm lucky to be near you
You can see it in my face
But when I fucked my shit up too many times
Why would I let myself get down in the first place

I'm trying to keep my mind at bay
Sunflowers still grows at night
Waiting for a minute 
till the sun's seen through my eyes
Make it down down dododown
Make it dodown du du du
Waiting for a minute 
till the sun's seen through my eyes

And so she sat me down 
and told me that I didn't have to cry
Said I didn't need to get down and feel empty inside
And told me that she love me for as long as she's alive
And well maybe she's right
cause I hate it when I feel like I'm not me
See I honestly don't even know why
I I honestly don't even know why

I'm trying to keep my mind at bay
Sunflowers still grows at night
Waiting for a minute 
till the sun's seen through my eyes
Make it down down dododown
Make it dodown du du du
Waiting for a minute
till the sun's seen through my eyes"
755,Pears,Weston Estate,"The paintings on the wall, they keep haunting me
I wish I could recall what you've done to me
My feelings won't resolve till you talk to me
And I'm certain that you'll call, but I'm too naive


Sometimes I feel alone
Hide in my secrets you need to know
I cannot feel no more
All of my demons with me at home


I saw your face in the water
I can't replace what we started, I did
Everything that you could've wanted
Everything's better when you're honest
Out in public to keep me up
I don't like what I'm dreaming of
Things wе're taking don't give enough
I'm tirеd of hating what I've become


It's hard to deal with everything I'm ignoring
And to be real I probably won't even show it
I don't know why I wake up every morning
You don't know why you're with me in the moment
But please don't go away
I'll believe it all, every word you say
I can't take the fall, I need you to blame
You've been in my thoughts, running through my brain




Sometimes I feel alone
Hide in my secrets, you need to know
I cannot feel no more
All of my demons with me at home


I saw your face in the water
I can't replace what we started, I did
Everything that you could've wanted
Everything's better when you're honest
Out in public to keep me up
I don't like what I'm dreaming of
Things we're taking don't give enough

I think that I would rather sleep
I never wanna show
The way that I can bleed"

Will keep me wrong from right

When my better side takes hold of me

Stabilize with medicine

Intrusive thoughts 
Like cutting my hands off
Like jumping in front of a bus
Like how do I make this stop
When it 
Feels like my therapist hates me
Please don’t let me go crazy 
Put me in a field with daisies 
Might not work but I’ll take a maybe

Oh, been breaking daily 
But only me can save me

Crying like a fucking baby

Like burning my hair off
Like hurting somebody I love
Like does it ever really stop?
When there’s control I lose it
Incredibly impulsive
So scared I’m gonna end up doing something stupid!
But I try to contain it
Oh, It gets so draining
It’s like my heart is failing
Every night I’m contemplating
My inner voices saying tough
So I try to brush it off
Yeah, try to brush it off

764,The Kiss Of Venus,Paul McCartney(폴 맥카트니),"The kiss of Venus
 Has got me on the go
 She scored a bullseye
 In the early morning glow
 Then I asked her

 Have ya read the paper?
 Ok, people talkin'
 About which side they're takin'
 And if you know then baby what's your take on it?
 Does it make you want to leave?
 'Cause I could look the other way for you

 The kiss of Venus
 Has got me on the go
 She scored a bullseye
 In the early morning glow

 Reflected mountains in a lake
 Is this too much to take?
 Asleep or wide awake?
 And if the world begins to shake
 Will something have to break?
 Or would we stay awake?

 Have ya read the paper?
 People talkin'
 Without no education
 Go to college
 Go find your major
 Realize you're minor in the scheme of everything

 The kiss of Venus
 Has got me on the go
 She scored a bullseye
 In the early morning glow

 The kiss of Venus
 Has got me on the go
 She scored a bullseye
 In the early morning glow"
765,Slowly,Olivia Dean,"Down in Margate, had a sip of you

And it went straight to my head

I could have opened up, cried and almost been myself

But I took the piss instead

I find it hard

Hard to be soft

Stop staying I'm perfect

'Cause clearly I'm not

Just need to catch

Catch my breath

Go slowly, slowly

I know you're not supposed to know me

But I only see it when you show me

Slowly

I'll have to teach you how to hold me

So go on, hold me

Remember when you called us both a cab

And forgot you had your bike

And the whole way home

I thought how's he keeping up with me

He must be really into me

As I fight

The urge to fly

I find it hard

Hard to be soft

Stop staying I'm perfect

Clearly I'm not

Just need to catch

Catch my breath

Go slowly, slowly

I know you're not supposed to know me

But I only see it when you show me

Slowly

I'll have to teach you how to hold me

So go on, hold me

Go slowly, slowly

I know you're not supposed to know me

But I only see it when you show me

I'll have to teach you how to hold me

So go on, hold me

Yeah, maybe I'll be fine"

I think about you every time
Glasses of wine still stained with your lips
From the other night ooo
The scent of you is stuck on me
It lingers from our last goodbye
I'm counting every moment passing by
Till I get back inside ooo
Lemonade is sweeter when its your kind
Glitter always shimmers in the lime light
How the hell you end up on the side lines
You look so much better here on my side
When the hi hat hit the bassline
Yeah I heard that through the grapevine
In that Goyard sipping mai tai
You just hit right in the right light
In the morning running highlights
Every night with you we end up
Making headlines
You just so thick need that fisheye
Want you to open up so I can headline
Do you feel that it's like lightning in a bottle
When you push back
Run my fingers through your hair
And you say pull that
I can never get enough the way
You throw that ass
21 you wear them hoops like Mike
1 on 1 you looking oop just right
Praying you gone let me off the leash
Cause baby when you look that mean oh
Lemonade is sweeter when its your kind
Glitter always shimmers in the lime light
How the hell you end up on the side lines
You look so much better here on my side
When the hi hat hit the bassline
Yeah I heard that through the grapevine

767,10 Steps,Christian Leave,"Sixty dreams inside my mind today
Walking down the dirty pavement stray
Stroke of luck and being raised by the divine
Marcus and Maria stand too tall
Say that I don't live real life at all
But the moon still shines in my view of the world

Well, four years is a long time
To see everything you ever wanted to do fade out of light
And four years shouldn't define
Your sense of wonder in the world and if you'll ever make it in time

Sixty dreams inside my mind today
Oh, I've made my decisions my own way
Now I'm living in a house that's not my home
Like a star has fallen out of place
Left you cold and frozen in your state
Waste away in pity for your own lines

Well, four years is a long time
To see everything you ever wanted to do fade out of light
And four years shouldn't define
Your sense of wonder in the world and if you'll ever make it in time

I wanna be the man
So I can try to be big in the state that I'm in
I wanna hold your hand
So I can finally be what I know that I am
And we could feel the wind
While we float downstream in our ten-step plan
Turning 'round the bend
And we can finally see where it is that we'll land

Well, four years is a long time
To see everything you ever wanted to do fade out of light
And four years shouldn't define
Your sense of wonder in the world and if you'll ever make it in time"

없어지면 그리워
오 하늘도 파랑도 아닌 당신은

I just wanna love you I don’t wanna think about it

It’s not only physical

You’re my piece of mind showing me what I can’t find
Got me feeling emotional
When you’re near I can’t let go


I don’t wanna waste another moment
Without your love it’s hard to concentrate
It’s driving me insane
I could never love someone like I do you

I would never leave I swear this truth to you
Early or late any time of the day
Lemme celebrate you I can find all the ways
Aww lemme prove it to you now

Or just running around, taking on someone different
It ain't listening to your friend's questionable decision advice
It ain't about telling yourself that you'll find someone better
And that y'all really weren't all that good together
It's just getting to the point where seeing them don't kill you inside


Baby, it's about time
It's about time (Ah-ah-ah)
It's about time
It's about time


It ain't about changing your mind when there's some rainy weather
And it ain't punching a guy when you're starting to feel jealous
It ain't fixing the broken watch that you wear wrong on the right
It ain't about being at the party, it's what we're doing after
And it ain't all about the fussin', we can't forget the laughter, babe
'Cause getting over it is easier when we keep in mind

Oh and I hope life sucks for as long as you live

And probably looking for helpless ＿
It's getting lonely to run from the chase
But I can't help it if we're at the same place
I hope you get exactly what you give

And I hate you and your friends too
No wonder you failed English
But yet somehow I still wish you the best
Well maybe I'm the psycho
who told the cops 'bout your party
So I could give you a chance to say you're sorry
Oh god I hope you get exactly what you give

Should I say it one more time?

Should I put it in a song?

Can you stay another five?
Don’t want you to say goodbye

When I cannot trust you
I wanna **** you, but nah
Every time I look into your eyes I get lost
Like the world stop
You got me caught up like I fell in some quicksand
Damn, you was a quick bag
I didn’t really think that much of us
Who woulda thought that we’d make it this far and
I’d give you my heart
Just don’t fall apart
We’ll both play our part
I won’t party so hard

Let’s just hope for the best and
Let’s fall in luv

나는 환하게 웃는 네가 좋아
밝게 웃는 네가 좋아
둘이서 손잡고 고른 영화가
재미없어도 그냥 좋아
나는 맛있게 먹는 네가 좋아
그런 널 보고만 있어도 웃음이 나

사실은 난 그냥, 네가 좋아

사실은 난 그냥,

진짜로 난 그냥, 네가 좋아"

High in the starry blue,

So away we steal in a space mobile
A supersonic honeymoon

always only just a little game to you? 
All the time I felt you gave your heart 
I thought that I would do the same for you, 
Tell the truth I think I should have 
seen it coming from a mile away, 
When the words you say are, 
“Baby I’m a fool who thinks it’s cool to fall in love” 
If I gave a thought to fascination 
I would know it wasn’t right to care, 
Logic doesn’t seem to mind 
that I am fascinated by the love affair, 
Still my heart would benefit from 
a little tenderness from time to time, but never mind, 
Cos Baby I’m a fool who thinks it’s cool to fall in love 

Baby I should hold on just a moment 
and be sure it’s not for vanity, 
Look me in the eye and tell me 
love is never based upon insanity, 
Even when my heart is beating hurry up 
the moment’s fleeting, 
Kiss me now, 
Don’t ask me how, 
Cos Baby I’m a fool who thinks it’s cool to fall, 
Baby I’m a fool who thinks it’s cool to fall, 
And I would never tell 
if you became a fool and fell in Love"

But my hope is that you'll stay
We're two weary hearts aglow now
If you love me let me know
Once the moon should take her bow
Maybe you'll find the words to say
Still I've often thought that words
Would only get into your way
So if you love me let me know
Tell my heart which way to go

Heaven is in your eyes
Bright as the stars we're under

I'm in the mood for love?

Why stop to think of whether
This little dream might fade?

 Shake me up with pills to take
 Tell me why the bellyache

 Keep the good times rolling

 And layered to keep it warm

 There's some magic that makes me believe

But I know the mood I'm in
And if I lose, I win
But I have never had a lover before

And now I'm high
And now I'm low
And now I'm blue
And now I glowThe days are too long
The nights too sweet
It all depends on when we meetTake my hand, and I'll go mad
and turn away, and I grow sadI'm in love, what can I do?
My mood is you

Now I laugh and now I cry
You clipped my wing and made me fly
You entered the room and stopped my heart

And let me go, then I'm destroyedI'm in love, what can I do?

No matter what the future brings
As time goes by

Moonlight and love songs
Never out of date
Hearts full of passion
Jealousy and hate
Woman needs man
And man must have his mate
That no one can deny

trying to watch the cartoons through the static
thinking where I am going to be if I'm ever twenty three

dreaming of the green & gold
Just like the ancient stone
Every sunrise I know
Those eyes you gave to me they let me see
where I am coming from
Found an old friend
meeting my guitar in the city
feeling like a star in the city
and suddenly it seems where I am supposed to be oh..
and now I'm fully grown
and I am seeing everything clearer
just sweep away the dust from the mirror
we are walking hand in hand on the warm white sands
I'm looking at the life unfold

The older ones bite their tongues 
They can feel the magic in the air 
Family's flying into town 
Look a year older now 
It wouldn't be the same without them there 

Its gonna be a white Christmas 
Well I just know 
So Lets hang out underneath the mistletoe

This magic spell you cast

This is la vie en rose

When you kiss me heaven sighs

And though I close my eyes

I see la vie en rose

When you press me to your heart

I'm in a world apart

A world where roses bloom

And when you speak, angels sing from above

Everyday words seem to turn into love songs

Give your heart and soul to me

And life will always be la vie en rose

I'm startin' to seem like I'm trying too hard
To leave behind this way I feel for you
But now that it seems like
We're back where we were
I've got you here with nothin'
Left to think through
'Cause it's been so long
Since I put out this fire
This fire
But with one small spark
You light this desire
Again
I know it's been some time since
I've been by your side
But baby right this second
Let's leave the past behind
You burned me once before
I'm burnin' still tonight
But baby right this second
Let's leave it all behind
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh (Yeah)
I'm tellin myself that I won't feel a thing
So all I feel is the touch of your skin (Oh)
You touch me like you used to back then
I close you out
Only to bring you right back in (Yeah)
It's been so long since I put out this fire
This fire
But with one small spark
You light this desire
Again
I know it's been some time
Since I've been by your side
But baby right this second
Let's leave the past behind
You burned me once before
I'm burnin' still tonight
So baby right this second
Let's leave it all behind
I know it's been some time
Since I've been by your side
But baby right this second
Let's leave the past behind
You burned me once before
I'm burnin' still tonight

Hold your body close to mine 
Leave behind all of the worries on your mind 
I can see it in your eyes 
We've been waiting for this moment to arrive
And you make me feel 
Feel so shine and new 
Like I'll never be blue again 
And all magic feelings never fades 
I want to spend the rest of my days with you
Love me in that special way 
Let your lips say what no words can ever say 
Lets not waste another day 
Lock the door and 
Then we'll throw the key away
And you make me feel 
Feel so shine and new 
Like I'll never be blue again

902,Colour Me In Gold,JP Cooper(제이피 쿠퍼),"You colour me in gold.
 Lips like petals on my throat.
 And those fingertips like paintbrush strokes, paper boats softly float like a song we wrote.

But summer comes and summer goes.
 You change your hair, you change your clothes.
 The books you read help you explore the world that you believed in once before.

You colour me in gold.
 Kiss the freckles on my nose.
 With those blood red pomegranate lips taking sips, hand on hip.
 Your face could launch a thousand ships.

But winter comes and brings the snow.
 You change your job, you change your home.
 Still reading books about the ghost of a world you can't be living anymore.

And after all, you've been nothing but good to me.
 And the only way that I can pay you back is to daily seek those distant memories while I'm standing next to you.

So when spring time comes and blossoms grow, come take my hand, can we expose the hideaways, the hidden doors, the stories we believed in. (oohhh oooohh)
 The land that we both dreamed in once before. (ooooooohhh oooooohhhh oooooohhhhoooohhooo)

You colour me in gold."
903,Wonderful (Solo),Lianne La Havas(리앤 라 하바스),"Did the world get a little bit colder
Not wiser just a little bit older
So slow that we're bound to fall over oh
Did the heart grow a little bit harder
Too much too late too far too gone

But wasn't it kind of wonderful
Wasn't it kind of wonderful baby
Wasn't it kind of wonderful wonderful
You can trip flick a switch like a thief
Break the circuit between us
But electricity lingers 
In our fingers
Oh you can burn every fuse and refuse
Turn your positive minus
Electricity lingers
In our fingers

From here there's nothing but horizon 
Near dawn I'm searching for the sunrise
Remember when you
put the stars into my eyes oh

Wasn't it kind of wonderful
Wasn't it kind of wonderful baby
Wasn't it kind of wonderful wonderful
You can trip flick a switch like a thief
Break the circuit between us
But electricity lingers
In our fingers
Oh you can burn every fuse and refuse
Turn your positive minus 
Electricity lingers
In our fingers

Wasn't it kind of wonderful
Wasn't it kind of wonderful baby
Wasn't it kind of wonderful wonderful
Wasn't it kind of wonderful

This world has up and gone crazy
I'm out here working trying to make it
Girl, it's so rough in this city
There ain't no resting for the weary
So baby feel me
I need something to feel
So my spirit can heal

[Chorus:]
I need you to wrap 
them chocolate legs 'round me
So when I come home tonight, 
you'll make everything alright
When you wrap them 
chocolate legs around me
The memory of my day will quickly just fade away
When you come wrap them 
chocolate legs 'round me
Please, baby, wrap them 
chocolate legs 'round me

[Verse 2:]
Your cocoa skin against mine, babe
Is all I need to help revive me
Just touch me and I feel pure, pure love
You're the only thing I'm ever sure of
(your love I'm sure of)
I need some reminding
That God is still, He's still behind me
Baby, come take my soul and set me free

[Chorus:]
When you come wrap 
your chocolate legs 'round me
So when I come home tonight, 
you'll make everything alright
When you come wrap 
them chocolate legs around me
I need you to understand, 
and make me glad I'm a man
Deep inside you that's where I need to be
Oh, baby, 
wrap them chocolate legs around me

Oohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
I need some reminding
That God is still, He's still behind me
So, baby, take my soul and set me free
I want you to know how much you mean to me

The things I know now it's amazing
I've learned I have this thing called brain
Don't understand why I've escaped it for so long
We've just begun let's get to know each other
Like no one other
Have some fun
Forget everyone we don't wanna talk to
Don't wanna talk to you

Everything is A OK
Yeah, everything is OK
Everything is A OK

Haven't left this room in thirty days
The things I dream now, it is crazy
Me and Kanye West made lemonade
Got a little bit sad and then we cried for a while
But it was fun
Lemons in the sunlight
And the world was so quiet
Even though it was this once, this one time
I might be happy for the rest of my life


Everything is A OK
Yeah, everything is OK
Everything is A OK

Haven't left this room in thirty days
The things I know now it's amazing
I've learned I have this thing called brain
Brain, brain, brain, brain
Don't understand why I've escaped it

Face to face and I'm all jello slush wow
You have changed my whole world in an instant
Made me love all the parts that I didn't
And I wanted to tell you
that I may look away but
Don't get me wrong I really like your face 'cause
When we meet lips it's our sun kiss
Being with you so clearly dries up all the rain
Used to be so far from free
But when we're like this my darling
It's like sunshine all day
Didn't you feel the sun?
Sorry girl please forgive me if I stare
When I'm with you I lose all of my cares
Can you blame me you glow like the sunrise
Fall in love every time I look in your eyes
I'll try to be something wonderful to you
But with the way that you are
There's nothing I wouldn't do cause
When we meet lips it's our sun kiss
Being with you so clearly dries up all the rain
Used to be so far from free
But when we're like this my darling
It's like sunshine all day
And I'm not saying that I love you
But I know that I'm liking the view
If we take it slow we can intertwine
And make it bright like sunshine
When we meet lips it's our sun kiss
Being with you so clearly dries up all the rain
Used to be so far from free
But when we're like this my darling
It's like sunshine all day
How do you see right through?
And I know that you love me
when you look into my eyes
Don't need time cause you're all mine
And I hope that you want me
for the rest of your life

You walked away from me

You're putting me through
Might as well tell the truth
It's something I need

I'm loving you crazy
I know you wish it could be simple
But love can be a complicated thing
Cuz I've got a restless mind
And I waste my time
Going 'round in circles in my dreams
Might say that im ok but you
Don't know what you mean to me
Baby can't you see
It's something I need
Cuz' your love is amazing
I'm down on my knees
Darlin please save me
I'm willing to bleed

Callin' her while the shower goes
Then crawl back in bed, it's a shame

I probably should’ve known better
I probably should’ve known better
Every word you said
Yeah, you was sweet, but you was lying
Everything you covered up

Excusing all of your 'gotta go's'
Leaving me to be all alone
Then you took my heart just the same

Let the sun peak through

Maybe we can meet in a zoom

Or facetime anything that you want to
Just hit me up and I'll be there for you

I'll write you a letter
I'll sing you a song
I'll make things much better
Everything will be fine
And I promise that you'll be alright
And I know and I know
And I know it'll soon be over
And I know that things
Just won't be the same
So we just gotta wait a little bit patiently
I'll write you a letter

You've always been my home
There's nothing like you
You just take me to a place
Where it's so high
I wonder how we grow
Till we go grey and small
We just take a look and stars go pairing

Go all the way around to the start of it all
When you were just you and I was just me?
Don't wanna go back to the shit in between

But since we're standing face to face
There's nothing left to say but

You would still never wanna see me again

'Cause you could say ""I'm sorry"" in English, Spanish, and French
Still, I'd never wanna see you again

You got a lot on yours
But you sound like a love song baby
Four on the floor
I know that sometimes we fight
Sometimes ignore
But when could pull it together
See what's in store
Sink slowly
Just hold me
I just want to spin around
In circles I'll fall on the ground
Down and drunk and dizzy for it
Come on I'll fall on the ground
I just want to spin around
(With you) in circles I'll fall on the ground
In bed with the bottle open
Give me that sweet shot of loving
No I don't know where we're going
But I want to be alone with you
In bed with the bottle open
Give me that sweet shot of loving
No I don't know where we're going
But I want to be alone with you
Down and drunk and dizzy for it
Come on I'll fall on the ground
I just want to spin around

shouting to hear the echoes

Falling stars come for me

Bitter winds fly for me like 
I need nothing
Please meet a warmer 
soul than me

Ha, stay Spring with you no more

Ha, cheerful twitter

And it’s the simple things you say
And how in bed we play
It’s the way you kiss my cheek 
when you think
That I’m asleep
I love it so much

I love you words 
I never say friends make fun 
but I tell you every day anyway 
lately you been getting me home safely 
Wake up love the coffee that you make 
Ask me how my night was 
I like us its so easy 
and we don’t ever fight 
cause you don’t blow up 
my phone when your home alone
Assuming that I’m doing what a guy does
Trust with just the right amount of lust
Even loved by my family that a must 
and fun everything we do me and you
My song comes on 
and you dance n sing too 
with the windows down like Gs 
we don’t care who’s around or who sees
And everyone is jealous of my ride 
because you sitting in the passenger side 

It’s the simple things you do
I just can’t get enough of you
It’s that perfume that you wear and 
The way you do your hair 
That I love so much
And it’s the simple things you say
And how in bed we play
It’s the way you kiss my cheek 
when you think
That I’m asleep
I love it so much

Everyday scrubbing 
it loving it cruising freeways 
in our PJs cause that’s the fun of it unless 
You wear that pretty black dress O yes
Catch me in a suit so 
I can look as good as you but I don’t
O well with a that smile 
that you wear so well 
And the way that you cry 
in movies pass you the ball 
and you pass it back to me

Beer s with the guys aint no thing 
it’s your eyes and the simple things
That make this work like it should 
when you rock my shirt o you look so good 
So take my hand stay 
as long as you can with the man
That tells all the jokes only you understand 
and I promise to be honest 
if you promise to accomplish love 
all we need is love"

Something that you never
Knew you needed more of
We can't change the things
We can't control
It's summer somewhere
So you shouldn't be so cold
But you can't even look me
In the eye if you tried
We can try we can try
I see us dancing by ourselves
We do it better with
No one around yeah
Just you in my imagination
Yeah in my imagination oh
Just use your imagination
Just use your imagination
I see us dancing by ourselves
We do it better with
No one around yeah
Just you in my imagination

So many things so many things

996,"Make It Work (feat. Anderson .Paak, Asher Roth & Donnie Trumpet)",Blended Babies,"I said it's worth more mentally
When you can touch but keep the peace
Its simple, but deceptively
I feel your warmth, I know your taste
I fell in love with your word
I know that you're worth it
I really love when it's earned
It seems like you want this
And when it's done to the dirt
Who could regret this?
I fell in love with your word
It seems like you're worth it

I wanna make it work
I wanna make it good if it kills me
You have to be hurt, to ever feel good
I wanna make it work
I wanna make it good 'til tomorrow
You have to be hurt, to ever feel good

(Uh huh, you know what I'm saying, so it's like)
I'm learning to take it slow but I don't wanna though
Especially tonight you look 
phenomenal, simply astronomical
I had a moment where I zoned 
and thought of us alone
I had you moaning, yeah, I wanna jump your bones
But it takes more than a boner 
for us to make a happy home
But when I grow up big and strong, 
I sure don't wanna live alone
So fuck the phone, I cross the ocean in a boat
I have to row cause flowing's too slow
And both motors are broken
And the sky opens up and I don't have a raincoat
Cause I threw everything 
I own out for this hand-written note
That says ""I wanna make it work"", 
that might not even work
Cause do I really believe that two people 
on this Earth are meant to be?
Eventually, I guess we'll see 
but in the meantime let's roll this weed
Turn out free time to you and me time
Turn our free time to you and me time
Let's turn our free time to, you know

I wanna make it work
I wanna make it good if it kills me
You have to be hurt, to ever feel good
I wanna make it work
I wanna make it good 'til tomorrow
You have to be hurt, to ever feel good

It feel good don't it?
A little longer
I need you all night
And we a one now
And she's alone now
And I'mma get it right
A little longer
Until we get it right
Until we get it right
I wanna make it work
And make it good 'til you feel it
You have to be hurt, to ever feel good

I wanna make it work
I wanna make it good if it kills me
You have to be hurt, to ever feel good
I wanna make it work
I wanna make it good 'til tomorrow
You have to be hurt, to ever feel good"

On the way you used to smile at me
I used to write them for you daily
But my thumbs are running dry lately
No one wants to hear a song
About the bitch that broke my heart
I should have listened to my mama
She saw through you from the start

But now we're here in Regent's Park
Amongst the flowers and I wish it would rain
'Cause in the sun, you look so lovely
That I'm falling for you over again
Since I have nothing left to say
That will make you change your mind
I'll say goodbye on a beautiful spring day

It was a place not too dissimilar to this one
Where I first saw your face
You look like home, sat all alone
I should have found somebody cheaper to chase
Tragically, nobody told me
How expensive you would be
I lost more than money, dear
You knocked the swagger out of me

But now we're here in Regent's Park
Amongst the flowers and I wish it would rain
'Cause in the sun, you look so lovely

I don't like feelings or feeling like running from something
And feeling so out of control
I know that the feeling is gone
I'm spending too much time alone
I'm hopin' you pick up the phone

And ring me when you wanna stay overnight

I'll play them all of my favorite songs
That lady is my favorite one

I can't wait for you
To come my way

Fiendin' for ya love
All worth it for the waiting

Give you what you need
Take you where he won't
Can feel it when we're all alone
Know you're wanting something more
My heart is like an open door
Just ring me when you wanna go

I'll wait

Hold a place 'til you're comin home

Could we take it back to wherever it started from
Could we take it back to wherever it started from

If we only let it
Would it all fade away
Might we just forget it
If we don't choose to make it stay
And I know this hazy in between
Is like a confused and lucid dream
But when the time comes
Could we take it back to wherever it started from
Could we take it back to wherever it started from

So where are we going to
Where are we going to
Where are we going to

So we can make our promise
But who's to say if it will keep
I know that's how you want it
Wish I could say the same for me
So who knows what's held for us in store
I secretly wish I knew for sure
But when the time comes when the time comes
Then we'll take it back could we take it back 
could we take it back to wherever it started from
Could we take it back to wherever it started from

I'm falling for you
And I can't quit it
'Cause I'm stuck on you
And it might be pathetic
And you might be skeptical
But I just want to be with you
Please tell me boy
Can you get a clue?
Or come through
'Cause I just want to be with you
I'm scared
Of telling you how I feel
Maybe it's better
If I just try to conceal the truth
For me and for you
But I'm still stuck on you ooh ooh
I I'm still falling for you
For you"

Come let me in
Take my heart by the hand
And lead me back to your room
And sing me your tune

You don't have to hide his things
I'm fine with all the sorrow that tomorrow brings
Whoa-oh-oh, Rosie
Don't you know my love is true
'Perdon' and 'lo siento', see,

Yeah do you ever wonder

On his own and
The demons that he's facing alone
I hate that sometimes I can't go home
And it ain't just the same on the phone no
But everybody's gotta go on
Don't they? (yes we do baby)
So if you need a hero (if you need a hero)
Just look in the mirror (just look in the mirror)

And everybody's hurting
Everybody's going through it
But you just can't give up now

Someday we'll find the love

When the flowers bloom
Kali what you mean?
I take it offensive
'Cause I'm the hottest flower boy
That popped up on the scene
Feeling better better than ever
'Cause your umbrella brella (brella light)
Sun is beaming on me like headlights
Beaming on bambi
Now let's pretend the street is the room
And you are a camry
'Cause your drama candid
The tito to my randy

I know times are rough
But winners don't quit
So don't you give up
The sun'll come out
But we've been struggling endless days
Someday we'll find the love
'Cause after the storm
I know it's hard
But do you even really try?
Maybe you could understand
When all you had to do was ask
And just open your mind
When everything is passing by
And all you had to do was try
Yeah all you had to was try
Try try try try try
All you had to do was try

Will never warm my heart

'Cause you wear it like a coat
All this feeling second best
It's got me by the throat, I know
That I've been obsessing in the worst way


Oh, I heard it from a woman on the internet
She told me to eat well and try to love myself
Then maybe I won't wish that I was someone else

To be more like you

Look, I don't wanna fight
No, I just wanna swap our bodies for a day
Imagine I could drive
With the top down
Back and forth across LA
And every time she mentions your name
She says it like a prayer
Getting caught up on the syllables
I wish I didn't care, but no
Oh, maybe I'm the one she had to outgrow



Oh, I heard it from a woman on the internet
She told me to eat well and try to love myself
Then maybe I won't wish that I was someone else

I got these insecurities
They're all mine, there's nothing you can
Do, do, do, do, no
And look
It's true, it's true, it's true, it's true
The other day I caught myself
Just looking at pictures of you
You, you, you, you, no



Oh, I heard it from a woman on the internet
She told me to live a life of no regret
So maybe I won't take you on as such a threat
Tell me how, tell me how
Oh, I know that I've been flirting with the enemy
But please don't be so perfect right in front of me

 Thinking 'bout your body, how it feels when it's on mine

 And every word you say to me is probably a lie

 So look me in the eyes, tell me that you want me
 Tell me pretty lies, tell me I'm the only
 Even if you don't mean it, touching you is holy
 Maybe fake love is better than feeling lonely

 Better than feeling lonely
 Better than feeling lonely
 Better than feeling
 Maybe fake love is better than feeling lonely

 (Maybe fake love is better than feeling lonely)

 Wish that I could be someone who does everything right
 But that just seems so boring, I would rather chase the highs

 I've got some stories I still need to write
 And I don't care if that shit fucks up my life
 So call me a psycho and maybe you're right
 But I love it

 So look me in the eyes, tell me that you want me
 Tell me pretty lies, tell me I'm the only
 Even if you don't mean it, touching you is holy
 Maybe fake love is better than feeling lonely

 Better than feeling lonely
 Better than feeling lonely
 Better than feeling
 Maybe fake love is better than feeling lonely

 I'd rather love and lose than never even get to love you
 I don't care if I get hurt, I'm fine
 I don't get to choose, the way I feel is just a true love
 And I don't care if I get hurt, I'm fine

 So look me in the eyes, tell me that you want me
 Tell me pretty lies, tell me I'm the only

I get so reminiscent, of when I didn’t give a fuck 
Back in the day when instant, meant noodles in a cup 
And our ideas weren’t twisted on what it takes to feel loved 
Now our flaws are like symptoms of never being enough 

Pre: 
You’re think we’re so impatient 
Way too self-obsessed 
We don’t know what work is, how can we be so stressed 
You say we’ve said goodbye to 
All our dignity 
Now validation’s our currency so... 

Chorus: 
All my friends are crazy 
Anxiety so trendy it’s gone mainstream 
I raise a glass to all confused and dazed too 
This world’s so damaged I don’t even blame you 

Verse 2: 
Future, a new reality 
We’d have phased out imperfection and what it means to be unique 
My waist would be so damn small cause I can’t afford to eat 
Maybe then I’d be happy with myself maybe then I can breathe 

Pre: 
You think we’re so damn anxious 
Think we’re so depressed 
If it’s so easy why’s it, harder to connect? 
We all told to stay woke 
There ain’t no time for sleep when all our standards getting hard to meet so.. 

Chorus: 
All my friends are crazy 
Anxiety so trendy it’s gone mainstream 
I raise a glass to all confused and dazed too 
This worlds so damaged I don’t even blame you

Dodging water guns under tea stained suns 
If I took your pain, please tell me you’d stay 
Promise that I’d do whatever it takes

My hand's out I wanna throw my cards now
Making your name our hometown
But all my trains are here
Please don't be worried
No doubt I'll found you in our old crowd
So many things to say if you stay
So stay young

And I'll get nowhere tryna do it at once

That I'll break my back tryna run home to
Because oh my god I want you to be the one

I wanna make my mother feel things
I wanna have the marching band
But right now it's just me
And steel strings lonely

I know it's hard know that I'm never there

When you're low
We'll stay young until we wanna be old
Electric blankets so we're never cold
'Cause you have always been my ticket home
And we stayed young
So stay young
I know that I'm talking too much
And I'll get nowhere tryna do it at once
But oh my god I wanna be someone

At the local pool?
But wherever I know you from
You put me in a good mood
And so I changed the channel
From the local news and weather
It's FIFA '98 with the surround sound
I hope my housemates don't freak you out
Or better still they're not around
Way up here on my trapeze
Please don't shoot me down
I love the way we hate these clowns
And for a minute there
You had me shook waitin'
Holdin' on a health line
I just wanna take you out for the summer
I would never swap you out for another
I'm kind of scared of your eldest brother
We've been dressin' up
'Cause we look like stunners
Girl why does it feel like
It's real for the first time?
Girl why does it feel like
It's real for the first time?
Girl why does it feel like
It's real for the first time?
Girl why does it feel like
It's real for the first time?
Why does it feel like it's real for the first time?
And life's on hold again
Your elbows on the table
But I'll let it slide for now
You almost got carried away and said yes
I'd have loved that
Let's grab a jo' off a friend
Then smoke it out the window
Never mind the neighbour's cat
He always stares at me like that
Moroccan bee sting
Colin the Caterpillar left over from my birthday
What the fuck? I'm actually in love
Lucid as my dreams
And still struggling with decisions
Coffee stains and urban wisdom
I just wanna take you out for the summer
I would never swap you out for another
I'm kind of scared of your eldest brother
We've been dressin' up
'Cause we look like stunners
Girl why does it feel like
It's real for the first time?
Girl why does it feel like
It's real for the first time?
You pour the wine I'll pour a cup of tea
Strain our eyes to adjust
To the jarring colour scheme
And mood lights and house plans
Grand Designs and channel surfin'
Driftin' with these solar winds
We stay searchin'"
1044,thank you for coming,ROLE MODEL,"I made friends
With some kids who used to hate me
'Cause they're the ones who made me
Exactly who I am
Shaking hands
With some girls who never call me
And always made me sorry
For acting who I am
Thank you all for coming
I'd be nothing without you
Don't tell yourself you're sorry
'Cause it's hardly ever true
Do do do do do
Do do do do d d do
Do do do do do d do

Do do do do do
Do do do do d d do
Do do do do do d do
Do do
Make some noise
For the kids who won't sit next to me
'Cause they're the ones rejecting me
For being who I am
One last dance with the girl
Who's way too good for me
'Cause somehow it felt good to me
You notice who I am
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But words just make me stronger
I kiss the cheeks of freaks and geeks
'Cause I don't have much longer
On my way to heaven's gate
So please don't try to stop me
Life is tough but I made up with people
Who forgot me
Thank you all for coming

1045,Shake It For Me (feat. 2 Chainz),Austin Mahone(오스틴 마혼),"In the night when the sun goes down
 And your wild side comes out
 Baby, that's when you shake it for me
 Soon as that door's shuts
 Turn the bed to a club
 Baby, that's when you shake it for me

 Fingers on your clothes, girl
 I been thinking that you always worked out
 Living in LA now
 But I swear you move like you come from the south
 When we getting private
 You show me tricks you don't show no one else
 I wonder where you learned that
 Want you to show me

 Oh I can tell that you're a pro girl 'cause you do it right
 Then you become an other person when I hit the lights
 I could've sworn you were a dancer in another life
 I gotta know, I gotta know

 'Cause in the night when the sun goes down
 And your wild side comes out
 Baby, that's when you shake it for me
 Soon as that door's shuts
 Turn the bed to a club
 Baby, that's when you shake it for me
 And you go up and you come down
 You turn around and then you poke it out for me
 When you get my love and your body erupt
 Baby, that's when you shake it for me

 Shake it like a tambourine, girl
 You see only you do that things you do
 In and outta jeans, girl
 Makes no difference to me to see you outta tune
 It's gotta be magic
 Some type of illusion, baby
 I wonder where you learned that
 Want you to show me

 Oh I can tell that you're a pro girl 'cause you do it right

 (Yeah, 2 Chainz)
 Turn the bedroom to a nightclub
 I got idea, yes a light bulb
 Then I lay back, let you get on top
 See if you can join the bike club
 First you told me you don't like clubs
 Unless you see it's the right one
 Outta all the girls that left
 I'm starting to think you're the right one
 We make a movie and sequel
 We don't need siskle and eber
 I'm like an eagle that's eager
 I turn to a beast when I need you
 Wait 'til the dark when I see you

 'Cause in the night when the sun goes down
 And your wild side comes out
 Baby, that's when you shake it for me

1046,Stop,Anthony Ramos,"Sometimes I wish my life was

Double tap the good ones
And just Photoshop the bad

Even when my feet are up
My mind is runnin' fast (Fast)
When I'm home I get impatient
When I'm gone I kinda hate it
'Cause my life works like that
Sunsets and open water
Skies full of technicolor
Beauty right in front of you
There's so much to discover if you
Stop breathe it in for the moment
Stop give it a minute and you'll own it

The window of a train
But my vision blurry
So it all just look the same
All the people and the places
All the voices and the faces
They all just stare right back
Long talks and cups of coffee
Waking up and saying sorry
Love is right in front of you
We can finally see each other if we

Won't wait in the grocery lines
It's a bummer
And I wanna cry for fun
Don't gotta be something wrong

What do I do when I'm stuck
In a bubble with you
And I can't seem to shake that
What do I do when I'm stuck
In a bubble with you
And I can't seem to shake that
Might be my biggest fan
But when you get in bed you're lazy
Say you'll be movin' in
So you can be my man
You're stressing me out
I need a hideout
I'd rather be with the swine
Ignoring the parking signs
Won't wait in the grocery lines
It's a bummer
I wanna cry for fun
Don't gotta be something wrong
'Cause my heart is either numb or on fire
What do I do when I'm stuck
In a bubble with you
And I can't seem to shake that

 Now let me tell it to your face

 You're a lonely cactus
 All on your own
 You're on the attack but
 You sit by the phone
 A lonely cactus
 In the desert sun
 But you're scared if you get too close

 You wonder why nobody tries anymore
 You bleed us dry still want it all
 There's more to life than chasing you in circles
 Do you want to run at all

 Underneath what you do
 There's nothing but blue
 And pieces that don't have a place
 I'm so tired of hearing
 Leave your name and number
 Now let me tell it to your face

 You're a lonely cactus
 All on your own
 You're on the attack but
 You sit by the phone
 A lonely cactus
 In the desert sun
 But you're scared if you get too close
 You'll hurt someone

 I'll weather the storm
 And I'll take on these thorns
 Cause I miss you
 I'll break through armour you've worn for so long
 Cos you miss me too

 You're a lonely cactus
 All on your own
 You're on the attack but
 You sit by the phone
 A lonely cactus
 In the desert sun
 And you're scared of getting too close

 You're a lonely cactus
 All on your own
 You're on the attack but
 You sit by the phone
 A lonely cactus
 In the desert sun
 You're scared if you get too close
 You'll hurt someone
 You'll hurt someone
 You're so scared
 That you'll hurt someone"

내 맘 절대 물들지 않아요
아무도 찾지 않는 나를 따라
애꿎은 비만 내려요"
1112,Black Dog,Arlo Parks,"I'd lick the grief right off your lips
You do your eyes like Robert Smith
Sometimes it seems like you won't survive this
And honestly it's terrifying
Let's go to the corner store and buy some fruit
I would do anything to get you out your room
Just take your medicine and eat some food
I would do anything to get you out your room
It's so cruel
What your mind can do for no reason
I'd take a jump off the fire escape
To make the black dog go away
Alice I know that you are trying
But that's what makes it terrifying
Let's go to the corner store and buy some fruit
I would do anything to get you out your room
Just take your medicine and eat some food
I would do anything to get you out your room
It's so cruel
What your mind can do for no reason
It's so cruel
What your mind can do for no reason"

We skip a beat (Beep beep beep)

They're killing me
I don't know what you want
But I know what I need
The 'goodbyes' the 'hellos'
The 'i need you' 'no I don't'

You knock and I let you in
Loving you is my greatest sin
Loving you is my greatest sin
Loving you is my greatest sin
Youngin'
Look uh
Sorry I missed your call I was on a jet
I been so zoned out
Tryna figure out what's next
So scared to fail I'm calculatin' my every step
Gotta watch my back and keep my strap
But nonetheless
I think about you when I'm gone
Wishing I could hold you
Probably home wishin' someone come
And love you how they 'posed to
And I hope you see this letter
'Fore it's too late
I hope chasin' my dreams
Don't get in the way
I blame my struggles
And my uncles for my hustlin' ways
I'm way in Michigan right now
Lookin' at real estate
Lord knows I wanna lay ya down
But I'm chasin' cake
Can't go back broke stay on the go
That's all that's on my brain

Then I love you can't blame you
She say I love you but don't trust you
Can't change you

Gotta stop running sometimes
I'm in your city tonight
And these lights
Make me feel so inspired
Going higher and higher and higher
Taking me higher
Higher and higher and higher
Hey I'm kinda glad you didn't pick up
I kinda just called to hear your voice so
Your voice recording was enough
Ugh I should hang up what am I doing? Um
So uh I feel kinda dumb but uh
I miss you I've been thinking about you
I've been thinking about our love
And how much I miss your touch
I miss being around you
Hearing your laugh and holding your hand
I think of you every day
I hope and I wish that you're doing okay
I want us to go back to the old days
Because I miss you
And I just thought of you
So I thought I'd call you
To tell you that you cross my mind
And I took that as a sign
That I should call and say hi
So that's all hi
I hope you don't think I've lost my mind
I hope you don't think I'm crazy
This message is getting long
So I just say bye but
The idea of you listening to this
The thought of you
I can't hang up
I'm in your city tonight
And these lights make me feel so inspired
Going higher and higher and higher"
1121,Peace Be Still,Adria Kain,"I'm alone all the time
‘Cus its madness
And its chaos
Moving through my mind
Creeping in my life
Is a monster
Made of fear and sadness alive
Inside of my head
I've tried to let go of all the things
I don't like here
Despite all the nightmares
I realigned with myself
And who I choose to be today
With or without the things that I want
Is better than anything else
Peace
Peace be still
Peace
Peace be still
Mmmm yeah
I'd rather be caught up
Sitting pretty while I'm sipping on a Paloma
At a spot right outside of the Casa Loma
Frankincense the aroma
And I really wish I didn't feel so alone
Where I'm living is not my home
But I'm holding onto faith
I can't let it get away
If I could change just one thing in my life
I'd turn it into a paradise
Where the water's made of magic
And the garden grows golden leaves
So I can be still
Peace
Peace be still
Peace
Peace be still"

Even when you're close
Can't take the silence

We gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we
Should and say we're good
Chrorus
We're not meant to be
Like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least
Agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge
You when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't
Be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we
Should and say we're good
No need to hide it
Go get what you want
This won't be a burden
If we both don't hold a grudge
I think it's pretty plain and simple
We gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we

Now you're holding this against me
Like I knew you would
I tried my best to make this easy
So don't give me that
Look just say we're good
We're not meant to be

So let's at least
Agree to go our separate ways

1129,Let Her,Esperanza Spalding(에스페란자 스팔딩),"You just walked in to the quiet quiet after the stars yes 
It's such silent and you sense that something's wrong 
Hmmm something's surely wrong 
And you saw the letter the keys laying on the counter 
But you know just what it means and grab the phone to call her 

Now is this another awful good threat 
She made cool jokes or she made good these threats to finally leave you 
Tears roll up in your eyes which you won't let you cry and finally 

Chorus 
She's gone bye bye so long 
Let her 
She's gone bye bye so long 
Love goes on 

Apartment stripped in silence 
Still you hear each make up 
And all those crazy ways you forgive loved you 
Now that you're all alone 
You realize she filled your life with litter 
Her kisses used to thrill 
Now the after taste is bitter 
With the memories from the mess you've endured when 

Chorus 
She's gone bye bye so long 
Let her 
She's gone bye bye so long 
Love goes on"

I should be the one you're dancing with
Spinning with a vodka coke
Everybody at my fingertips
I was gonna get my coat
And baby you were meant to follow me
And I was gonna act surprised
Even though I'd know you wanted me
It's not like I've been crying
There's just smoke in my eyes
Coz this aint no John Hughes movie
Where the girl gets the guy
You look right through me
Everytime you walk by
I keep waiting for the heartbreak music
That's never gonna come
Coz if you don't want me
Then you're not the one
Sitting on the bathroom floor
Tryna get my composure back
Think I built it up too tall
Knew I should've worn my adidas
Maybe if I'd reigned it in
You wouldn't wanna kiss somebody else
And you don't owe me anything so I'm
Just gonna walk home by myself
It's not like I've been crying
There's just smoke in my eyes
Coz this aint no John Hughes movie
Where the girl gets the guy
You look right through me
Everytime you walk by
I keep waiting for the heartbreak music
That's never gonna come
Coz if you don't want me
Then you're not the one
What am I gonna say what am I gonna do
All of our stupid friends
Know that I'm here for you
Guess I misunderstood
Thought you liked me too
What am I gonna say what am I gonna do
Everyone told me so
Don't wait around for you
Guess I misunderstood
Thought you liked me too
Coz this aint no John Hughes movie
Where the girl gets the guy
You look right through me
Everytime you walk by
I keep waiting for the heartbreak music
That's never gonna come
Coz if you don't want me

You were the popular one, the popular chick
It is what it is, now I'm popularish
Standing on the field with your pretty pompons
Now you're working at the movie selling popular corn
I could have been a mess but I never went wrong
Cause I'm putting down my story in a popular song
Said I'm putting down my story in a popular song
My problem, I never was a model,
I never was a scholar,
You were always popular,
You were singing, all the songs I don't know
Now you're in the front row
Cause my song is popular
Popular, I know about popular
It's not about who you are or your fancy car
You're only ever who you were
Popular, I know about popular
And all that you have to do is be true to you
That's all you ever need to know
Catch up cause you got an awful long way to go
Catch up cause you got an awful long way to go
Always on the lookout for someone to hate,
Picking on me like a dinner plate
I'd hid during classes, and in between them
Dunk me in the toilets, now it's you that cleans them
You tried to make me feel bad with the thing you do
It ain't so funny when the joke's on you
Uh, the joke's on you
Got everyone's laughing, got everyone clapping, asking
How come you look so cool?
Cause that's the only thing that I've learned at school
So that's the only thing I've learned at school
My problem, I never was a model,

1148,Selfish,Jack Gray,"You play my heart like I play my guitar
Break all the strings cause I play way too hard
As fake as it sounds it was real from the start
Passion is everything until it's not

I could tell it was downhill from here
I reversed engineered a plan out of my fears
They grew strong (way too strong)
I'll hold on (not for long)
Was surprised this ain't where I belong

Growing distant you could tell
I hate sleeping by myself
Is it selfish? I can't help it
Slowing drifting miles apart
Save yourself I'm crashing hard
Call it selfish I can't help it

I lie awake in my bed till it's dawn
It didn't get easier guess I was wrong
Scared to let go of what's already gone
Passion is everything until it's not

I could tell it was downhill from here
I look back on the years you held back but your tears
We're too strong (way too strong)
I'll hold on (not for long)
Was surprised this ain't where I belong

Growing distant you could tell
I hate sleeping by myself
Is it selfish? I can't help it
Slowing drifting miles apart
Save yourself I'm crashing hard
Call it selfish I can't help it"

They’re filling up the room
But I don’t see nobody
Nobody else but you
We hate the taste of captain
Let’s make it feel brand new
If I’ve done it a thousand times again
i’ll do it with you too
Heard you’re done with the small talk
You'd Rather cut to the chase
Hang your heart in a chapel
But they force you to date
Oh I'll try to be different
If you meet me tonight
We could spill our secrets
And the scripts we can’t rewrite
Done trying to be cool
We're spinning around
Caught in the crowd
Hoping it dies down slowly
And if I step on your feet
I hope you won’t leave
We'll be together lonely"

You never told me you would
But the way that you smiled was a promise, I swear

Fell asleep by the phone
I missed a message or two
Deleted them 'cause they weren't you

I wrecked my house a hundred times just to see you walk into a room
But there was money in your laugh, so babe

There's nothing else I could do
Oh babe, there's nothing else I could do
(There's nothing else I could)

I miss the shape of your voice
I miss the nape of your neck
I miss the weight of your words
I miss the bruises they left

Started reading the Times
Just to look for your name -
I couldn't find it
They must have made a mistake

I broke my knuckles in a fight, you were crying in the back of the room
And now the world is on fire, but babe

There's nothing else I could do
Oh babe, there's nothing else I could do
(Oh)

And they can dance to the songs
And they can drink all the wine
Because the high might be theirs
But all the bottles were mine

And then you're crashing my car
And now I'm taking the blame
There's nothing else I could do
They must have made a mistake

Oh

Babe, they must have made a mistake
Oh
They must have made a mistake
Oh babe, there's nothing else I could do
Oh babe, there's nothing else I could do

The shoulder to cry on
A heart to rely on
I know at times I made mistakes
Wish I could blow them all away
Won't you believe me when I say
I'm so much better now I've changed
I've only got myself to blame
Call me when it's over

Some nights I'll remember
Remember how we stayed up late
Remember all the songs we sang and played
Oh those nights I'll remember
From watching the sun's shining light move
Down your face until the dark midnight
Every time that I close my eyes
I fall asleep wrapped up
In your arms so tight
And every time you must say goodbye
I cannot let you walk out the door tonight
Oh mhm yeah
Walking down the street
I got my NMD'S right
On my feet with you right by my side
And it's you that's on my mind
Watching the TV
I got my favourite shows and
Snacks and I got you right in between
But I don't think that you should leave
Yeah
Some nights I'll remember
Remember how we stayed up late
Remember all the songs we sang and played
Oh those nights I'll remember
From watching the sun's shining light move
Down your face until the dark midnight
And now I've fallen but
You've caught me in your arms
Baby please don't let me go
Now that you're right here with me
I finally feel so good and free
Just say that I'm your
Girl and it's us against the world
Some nights I'll remember
Remember how we stayed up late
Remember all the songs we sang and played
Oh those nights I'll remember
From watching the sun's shining light move
Down your face until the dark midnight
Some nights I'll remember
(I think that I'll remember)
Remember how we stayed up late
Remember all the songs we sang and played
Oh those nights I'll remember (No)
From watching the sun's shining light move
Down your face until the dark midnight
(No yeah yeah)"
1160,Narcissist (feat. The 1975),No Rome,"Took a picture of all my flaws
Or you can take a video on your phone
And you know that I would talk
But I'm too afraid to pick you up and go home
I'm feeling Dazed like a magazine
Finding my own sanity
Wishing it'll all go away
Now we're smoking off the balcony
You're telling me profanities
Maybe it was never okay

345 that's where we stayed
She told me I'm a narcissist doing it again
Took a bunch of acid and she told me
Not again
Now I've gotta tell her that
I'm lovin' her friends

She told me I'm a narcissist doing it again
Took a bunch of acid and she told me 
Not again
Now I've gotta tell her that 
I'm lovin' her friends

And I've been seeing somebody
But I've not found a way to tell you
That I'm seeing somebody
There's not a nice way for me to say that
I've been seeing somebody
You know I want you to be happy
Since I'm seeing somebody
And then maybe we can get on with it

Stay out late I just wanna get stoned
Telling all your friends that I'm never at home
And my face filling up with blood
But you're still saying 
They don't like your bourgeois
Coughing up the promethazine
Living like an evergreen
Sorry for the things that I've done
Now Selena won't be friends with me
I was kissing Emily
I love you it was never your fault
(Got me like)

345 that's where we stayed
She told me I'm a narcissist doing it again
Took a bunch of acid and she told me 
Not again

You were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand
And you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
I wore a dress
You wore a dark gray t shirt
You told me I was pretty
When I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale
Time slows down whenever you're around

It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
You've got a smile that
Takes me to another planet
Every move you make everything
You say is right
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
All that I can say is now
It's getting so much clearer
Nothin' made sense
'Til the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale
Time slows down whenever you're around
Yeah yeah
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there

1164,Don't You Worry,Oh Wonder(오 원더),"We walked the city streets
At midnight when the world went quiet
We skipped our dancing
Feet along beside the taxi rides
If I'm honest it felt like love
And all the beats fell in
Between the silence that we shared
And all the trees were swaying
Softly in the thick black air
If I'm honest it felt like love
And you said stay here darling
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
I'm right here darling
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
It's us against the world
It's us against the world
It's us against the world
We let the freckles on
Our faces make a million stars
A constellation so amazing
That we saw a spark
If I'm honest it felt like love
And in the morning
You adored me 'til the sun went down
And then I knew you were
The one I couldn't live without
If I'm honest it felt like love
And you said stay here darling
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
I'm right here darling
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
It's us against the world
It's us against the world
It's us against the world
We built a little house and
Filled it with our little dreams
But shining brighter are
The moments that were in between
If I'm honest it felt like love
And now we're ready for the ending
We're hand in hand
A life so colorful
We didn't even need a plan
If I'm honest it feels like love
And you said stay here darling
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
I'm right here darling
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
It's us against the world

 Loving you makes me hate you too
 I know it could be anybody
 It should be anybody else

 Waking up still wearing your clothes
 I take a little piece of you home
 When my mom says ""Where'd you get those?""
 Just laugh and say ""I already know""

 Only God can save us now
 Go to bed still wearing your clothes

 Knowin' that you'll save me
 Laugh it off and take me home
 Caught me saying, baby
 Something's different lately
 It's better if it's left alone

 'Cause it's you, and all the things you do
 I know it could be anybody
 It should be anybody else
 Loving you makes me hate you too

And just like magic
Can make the whole world sing
That look in your eyes
Oh the joy it brings
When I hold you and you hold me
I know we're not not what we used to be
But we carry so much history
Put up my sails and I rode the wind
That led me here to you I'd do it all again
I know it won't always be the same
Feelings don't change they never fade away
When you're far from home
It's hard to know the way
But it's right there inside
When you need direction
Look to the stars
If you don't know where you're heading
Follow your heart
When you're lost I will guide you
I'm right there beside you
Like a map of your memories
And just like a compass
That leads the way
We may take the long road
But I'll never fade
When you're lost I will guide you
Oh tell me you'll try to
Remember on the darker days
Love is a compass
I see you there when I'm in my dreams
And just like a child full of possibilities
I can't help but smile
At the wonders of the world
'Cause I know I've been there before
I know it won't always be the same
Feelings don't change they never fade away
When you're far from home
It's hard to know the way
But it's right there inside
When you need direction
Try close your eyes
If you don't know where you're heading
Just hold on tight
When you're lost I will guide you
'Cause I'm right here beside you
In every memory
And just like a compass
That leads the way
We may take the long road

[JUNG:]
I could be the one who wins
I would give you everything
But I know that you're still sleeping next to him
You can do better, I'm better
So why is he closer than I've been?

Your secret, so heavy for me to be carrying
You told me you were ready so
I'll wait for you

I can feel how the winds are changing
'Cause you spend all your nights here lately
Hold me close, are you gonna let him go?
I don't know if I'm going crazy
Thinking you're gonna leave your safety
Hold me close, are you gonna let him go?

[Clara Mae:]
We could be the lucky ones
If we stay 'til morning comes
I don't know why I keep going back to him
I can do better, you're better
Tell me you won't let me down

[JUNG & Clara Mae:]
It feels like we're slipping
You're here but you're distant
You told me you were ready so
I'll wait for you

I can feel how the winds are changing
'Cause you spend all your nights here lately
Hold me close, are you gonna let him go?
I don't know if I'm going crazy
Thinking you're gonna leave your safety
Hold me close, are you gonna let him go?

I move slowly out of bed
Real quiet getting dressed
So sure you're sleeping still
Where you going? Where you going?
Won't you come back to bed?
Did you forget about the things you said?
You shouldn't leave just yet
Where you going? Where you going?

I can feel how the winds are changing
'Cause you spend all your nights here lately
Hold me close, are you gonna let him go?
I don't know if I'm going crazy
Thinking you're gonna leave your safety
Hold me close, are you gonna let him go?"

Am I lookin' lover in the arms of
someone new? Don't care
Am I lookin' for a future
when there might not even be a now?
Am I tryin' to buy a house
that's gonna burn down?

Just tell me what it is, what it's not
Just tell me, are we on? Are we off?
'Cause falling for you's always
such a long way down
You're drinkin' and it's real late at night
That's when you're good at
changing your mind
But if we're better off alone
Why did you pick up your phone?
Why did you pick up your phone?

Is it love? Is it strange
that I can feel the danger
If we leave it in-between?
Are we lost? Are we fine?
Don't wanna wait around
Matches, meet the gasoline
Tryin' to go, tryin' to stay
We're gettin' nowhere goin' both ways
So tired of the guessin'

Just tell me what it is, what it's not
Just tell me, are we on? Are we off?

1173,To The Sky,Owl City(아울 시티),"I used to call you after midnight
It was cold 'cause we both agreed
We were easy kinda weakly
Shipwreck in a sea of faces
There's a dreamy world up there
Dear friends in higher places
Carry me away from here
Travel light
Let the sun eclipse you
'Cause your flight
Is about to leave
And there's more to this
Brave adventure
Than you'd ever believe
Birds eye view
Awake the stars
'Cause they're all around you
Wide eyes will always
Brighten the blue
Chase your dreams
And remember me
Sweet bravery
'Cause after all those wings
Will take you
Up so high
So bid the forest floor goodbye
As you race the wind
And take to the sky
You take to the sky
On the hills of war and wonder
There's a stormy world up there
You can't whisper
Above the thunder
But you can fly anywhere
Purple burst of paper birds
This picture paints
A thousand words
So take a breath
Of myth and mystery
And don't look back
Birds eye view
Awake the stars
'Cause they're all around you
Wide eyes will always
Brighten the blue
Chase your dreams
And remember me
Sweet bravery
'Cause after all those wings
Will take you
Up so high
So bid the forest floor goodbye
As you race the wind
And take to the sky
You take to the sky
There's a realm above the trees
Where the lost are finally found
So touch your feathers
To the breeze
And leave the ground
Birds eye view
Awake the stars
'Cause they're all around you
Wide eyes will
Always brighten the blue
Chase your dreams
And remember me
Sweet bravery
'Cause after all those wings
Will take you
Up so high
So bid the forest floor goodbye
As you race the wind
And take to the sky
You take to the sky
You take to the sky"
1174,Love You For A Long Time,Maggie Rogers(매기 로저스),"Came in like a vision from the old west wind
 Like a bright new dream that I was stepping in
 I saw your face and I knew it was a sign
 And I still think about that moment all of the time

 You know that I could never make this up
 I found the reason I'm not giving up
 I felt the fever and I knew he was mine
 Oh I, I'm gonna love you for a long time

 And in the morning when I'm waking up
 I swear that you're the first thing that I'm thinking of
 I feel it in my body, know it in my mind
 Oh I, I'm gonna love you for a long time
 I'm gonna love you for a long time
 I'm gonna love you for a long time

 Oh, I never it, yeah, you took me by surprise
 While I was getting lost so deep inside your diamond eyes
 So many things that I still wanna say
 And if devotion is a river, then I'm floating away

 And in the morning when you pick me up
 And all the world is quiet, tip the mourning dove
 I feel it in my body, know it in my mind
 Oh I, I'm gonna love you for a long time
 I'm gonna love you for a long time
 I'm gonna love you for a long time

 Ooh, don't slow down now, gonna break me down
 Keep your hands in my hair, keep your mouth on my mouth
 Don't slow this down, never let me go
 Baby, don't you wanna see how far this thing can go?

 And in the morning when you wake me up
 I know that forever could never be enough
 I feel it in my body, know it in my mind
 Oh I, I'm gonna love you for a long time
 I'm gonna love you for a long time
 I'm gonna love you for a long time
 For a long time

 Oh, I'm gonna love you for a long time
 Ooh, I'm gonna love you for a long time

You got me on autopilot like a Telsa
On a s*x drive and you cut the tension
Yeah, you love the taste of my tattoos
Yeah, and your girlies say that I'm bad news
Yeah, from the second we met, had to have you
So let me ask you, is this what you imagined? Yeah

Now the whole world's going up in flames
But right now nothing matters

And go somewhere in the distance
'Cuz sometimes nothing really makes sense
And I wanna ditch all this and leave
Somewhere in the distance somewhere
Somewhere the future's bright
And you don't have a billion things
On your mind
Oh where sun doesn't set
So there's never a day that you forget
And it's always 5pm on a Saturday night
(Yeah yeah)
And you're not always thinking of everything

To take me outta this feeling
Need more than just tears
To fill this glass bath to half
And I'm sore from tattoos
I shoulda known wouldn't heal me
And I'm finding some peace
In starting wars with myself
Life goes on
Life goes on
No free will without the choice
How you gonna scream without the voice?
I can't think around the noise
It gets hard to avoid
It all gets harder to avoid
No free will without the choice
How you gonna scream without the voice?
I can't think around the noise
Life goes on when the lights go out
All things up gotta come back down
I'll end up strange if I don't go crazy first

Meet me after midnight
Crawl up on the rooftop
Candles burning up like stars in every sky
Keep me in your thoughts like
Words we try to live by
Verbalizing something hardest to describe
No free will without the choice
How you gonna scream without the voice?
I can't think around the noise
It gets hard to avoid
It all gets harder to avoid
No free will without the choice
How you gonna scream without the voice?

You should see the way the light dances off your hair
A million colours of hazel, golden and red
Saturday morning is fading
The suns reflected by the coffee in your hand
My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again

We were love drunk waiting on a miracle
Trying to find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh I won’t be silent and I won’t let go
I will hold on tighter ‘til the afterglow
And we’ll burn so bright ‘til the darkness softly clears

Oh I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh I will hold on to the afterglow

The weather outside’s changing
The leaves are buried under six inches of white
The radio is playing, Iron & Wine
This is a new dimension 
This is a level where we’re losing track of time
I’m holding nothing against it, except you and I 

We were love drunk waiting on a miracle
Trying to find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh I won’t be silent and I won’t let go
I will hold on tighter ‘til the afterglow
And we’ll burn so bright ‘til the darkness softly clears

Oh I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh I will hold on to the afterglow"

1204,i think too much,Christian French,"Sometimes I think I think too much
Can't stop my thoughts come all at once
Maybe I'm crazy maybe who knows
Could've been easy all along
But sometimes I think I think too much
I think I think I'm
Searching for answers high and low
I kinda can't stand the usual oh oh
I'm certain there's something more
That I don't know
And I don't know
But this isn't what I want
Questioning things I can't control
Finding my youth's been getting old
Losing myself when nothing's wrong
But who knows if
Sometimes I think I think too much
Can't stop my thoughts come all at once
Maybe I'm crazy maybe who knows
Could've been easy all along
But sometimes I think I think too much
I think I think I'm
Summin' up life in photographs
I'll say I'm alright when someone asks me
If I'm happy
But something ain't right
There's always more than that
There's more than that
I just haven't found the air
Still I'm
Questioning things I can't control
Finding my youth's been getting old
Losing myself when nothing's wrong
But who knows if
Sometimes I think I think too much
Can't stop my thoughts come all at once
Maybe I'm crazy maybe who knows
Could've been easy all along
But sometimes I think I think too much
I think I think too much
La la la da da
I think I think too much
La la la da da
I think I think too much
Questioning things I can't control
Finding my youth's been getting old
Losing myself when nothing's wrong
But who knows if
All of these hallways in my mind
Will always lead back to black and white
I'm hoping that one day I'll be fine
Sometimes I think I think too much
Can't stop my thoughts come all at once
Maybe I'm crazy maybe who knows
Could've been easy all along

There's something you can buy
With your credit card
It feels so natural
But you could have known me
This could be the way to the real thing
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh could've known
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh so can I go
I think I really feel down in my soul that
This could be the way to the real thing
We could go out and take on the night
Or take it easy whatever feels right
And I take you to places
Where you wanna go
Do you believe me now when I say

Since I've seen your face
And not a damn thing's changed
Since I drove by your place
I was hopin' and I'm prayin'
That one day you will change
But it's been 33 days
And you're still the same
I don't feel like I felt when I fell for you
And I don't and I won't say I miss you too
You had me feeling like I was the crazy one
Lies wrapped up 'till we came undone
Had love gave love but you gave me up
Fuck
You stole my heart and we grew apart
You charged my card up you totaled my car
I dealt with all that shit I never called it quits
Woke up one morning then called
And said all of this
Hello?
It's been 33 days
Since I've seen your face
And not a damn thing's changed
Since you begged me to stay
You told me it'd be different
And one day you would change
But it's been 33 days
And you're still the same
I don't need you you you
You had me me me
Fool me once twice three
Now I see see see
I don't need you you you
You had me me me
Fool me once twice three
So let me breathe

1211,Everything Sucks (Frank Walker Remix),Scott Helman,"I'm feeling sick
Think it's contagious
Don't wanna see
Nobody but you
I haven't tripped
But I can taste it
Don't wanna heal
For somebody new
Every single minute every second
I can hear my heart is whispering
Baby are you listening?
Everything sucks
I got fucked up on you
Give everything that I'll ever have
Just to get you back
That's some bad luck
'Cause I'm not done with you
Think about you on somebody else
I wanna kill myself
Everything sucks (Sucks sucks sucks sucks)
Everything sucks (Sucks sucks sucks sucks)
Without you
You're on my lips
In conversation
Don't wanna talk
'Bout nothing but you
My friends are pissed
Can't stop complaining
Get over it
But what can I do?
Every single minute every second
I can hear my heart is whispering
Baby are you listening?
Everything sucks
I got fucked up on you
Give everything that I'll ever have
Just to get you back
That's some bad luck
'Cause I'm not done with you
Think about you on somebody else
I wanna kill myself
Everything sucks (Sucks sucks sucks sucks)
Everything sucks (Sucks sucks sucks sucks)
Without you
Sleeping outside your residence
Hoping you come and let me in
Guess I probably burned that bridge
When I was crying on your front stop
Playing sad songs just to pretend
I'm not pathetic but you know I am
Can't see the bright side of anything
Without you it's like
Everything sucks
I got fucked up on you
Give everything that I'll ever have
Just to get you back
That's some bad luck
'Cause I'm not done with you
Think about you on somebody else
I wanna kill myself
Everything sucks (Sucks sucks sucks sucks)
Everything sucks (Sucks sucks sucks sucks)
Without you (Sucks sucks sucks sucks)

what a nice day to run away
Falling never slipping

I don't miss
Like I'm hard-way
If I can't get it
eventually like fuck it imma get another way 
I don't believe in happiness 
I'm searching for a imma stay 
Brodie want a grave
So I showed his ass to a better place
Everybody got a plate
Everybody just fucking straight 
Walls are closing 
from the drugs I'm using 
Can't cooperate

Really hate the thought in my head
I'm out of options
Wanna blow up
My bitch kill me instead
I don't believe in happiness
I think we live and forget
I hat this test 
You called it life
We live in Gell but we blessed
And the thought of giving up is sinking in

What I nice day to run away 
I been blowing my pain away yeah
Told you that I loved
you and I meant that huh
But you won't really really
like to listen like what
I'm just tired of the same shit
Different day
You used to keep me sand
But that changed 
Had to switch lanes
Had to pass that bitch yeah
Money on my mind
I just wanna get rich
I ain't got time don't ask me if I'm fine
Told you I loved you a million times 
Told you I loved you a million times

It's burned into my memory
And it won't ever leave
And how could I forget the way
You looked at me like an enemy
I could barely breathe
I thought things would get better
But it's taking forever
Will we ever be the same
Why does this feel so wrong
I said goodbye but I can't move on
And I'm the only one to blame
And that's why
I don't want to think about you
More than I have to
Don't wanna miss you
But I still do I still do
Was I a fool to walk away
Did love slip right through my hands
I don't want to think about you
But baby I still do
Mmmmm
Baby I still do
Mmmmm
Eight months and six days later
And no one's asked me how I'm doing
I was kinda hoping they would
And all your friends still talk to me
But they choose their words so carefully
Will I always be the enemy
I keep praying for a breakthrough
An explanation for why I hurt you
Is it wrong of me to wonder how you've been
In my closet there's a letter
That I'll send when things get better
Oh I hope that things get better
But until then
I don't want to think about you
More than I have to
Don't wanna miss you
But I still do I still do
Was I a fool to walk away
Did love slip right through my hands
I don't want to think about you

Hi? Would you keep going?
If I told your friend later
That you didn't mean nothing
If you posted about it
And I didn't even comment
If the songs weren't true

Would you still come looking for me?

'Cause you can't have everything
Your head and your heart
Won't feel the same

It ain't skipped a beat no
Feeling rested up
I ain't missing sleep no oh
Don't take it personal
If I can't reply now
I'm distant 'cause
I don't wanna be reached now
Won't let the ghosts of our past
Weigh my future down
I'm liberated
Energy's like a circle
It comes back around
Reciprocated
Don't shed no more tears
Won't gain no empathy from me
In the upcoming years
Oh I don't need your pity
Don't check on me
Oh don't check on me
If we're not together
And it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
And it looks like winter for you
Ain't call you back 'cause I let it go
I had to focus energy and just let it flow
And when we ride low
We were already gone
It wouldn't mean anymore to me now
I know it hurts you so bad
Just to see me happy
That I finally moved on
And you thought it wouldn't happen
At times I used to cry
Wouldn't know when I laughing
But I acted like I didn't notice
Oh don't go reaching out
'Cause you can't have everything
You can't kill a flame with gasoline
Even if it feels like it every time

1222,Cannonball,Damien Rice(데미안 라이스),"still a little bit of
your taste in my mouth
still a little bit of
you laced with my doubt
still a little hard to say
what's going on

still a little bit of
your ghost your weakness
still a little bit of
your face i haven't kissed
You step a little closer
each day
I can't say what's going on

Stones taught me to fly
Love taught me to lie
Life taught me to die
So it's not hard to fall
When you float
like a cannonball

still a little bit of
your song in my ear
still a little bit of
your words I long to hear
You step a little
closer to me
So close that
I can't see what's going on
Stones taught me to fly
Love taught me to lie
Life taught me to die
So it's not hard to fall
When you float like a cannon
Stones taught me to fly
Love taught me to cry
so come on courage
Teach me to be shy
'Cause it's not hard to fall
And I don't wanna scare her
It's not hard to fall
And I don't wanna lose
It's not hard to grow
When you know that you
just don't know"
1223,Thinking 'Bout You,Dua Lipa(두아 리파),"3 AM and my neighbors hate me
Music blasting shaking these walls
This time mary jane won't save me
I've been working later
I've been drinking stronger
I've been smoking deeper
But the memories won't stop
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high I can't get by
I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
Like poison coursing through me
So clear my vision is blurred
The haze won't put my mind at ease
I've been sleeping later
I've been breathing stronger
I've been digging deeper
But the memories won't stop
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high I can't get by
I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I want you all
Say it before you run out of time
I want you all
Say it before it's too late
I want you all
Say what I am feeling now
I want you all
Waiting is insane
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high I can't get by
I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

1225,Ordinary World,Katharine McPhee(캐서린 맥피),"The sun can't remember how to shine
And the colors all have faded into shades of gray 
There's no life in this hollow heart of mine 
Ever since you went away

Close your eyes and feel me hold you 
Can you lead me through this ordinary world
Let the sky cry, restless rain to wash away the miles 
Between us, 'cause without you it's just an ordinary world

If time could find a way to turn around 
I would walk along the stars, till I was back at your door
Every word, every word is spoken but without a sound 
And I found out what my heart is for

Close your eyes and feel me hold you 
Can you lead me through this ordinary world

Let the sky cry, restless rain to wash away the miles 
Between us, 'cause without you it's just an ordinary world

Hold your breath, here I come
Time to roll on mine 
Take back, to your arms 
Till we melt 
Underneath the blinding sun

Can't remember how to shine
You're the life in this hollow heart of mine

Close your eyes and feel me hold you 
Can you lead me through this ordinary world
Let the sky cry, restless rain to wash away the miles between us
'Till love can come redeem us 'cause without you 
It's just an ordinary World"
1226,September Song (Guitar Acoustic),JP Cooper(제이피 쿠퍼),"Our love was stronger than lightning
Soft as the cotton you lie in
Times we got hot like an iron you and I
Our hearts had never been broken
We were so innocent darling
We used to talk 'til the morning you and I
We had that mixtape on every weekend
Had it repeating had it repeating
You were my september song
Summer lasted too long
Time moves so slowly when you're only fifteen
You were my september song
Tell me where have you gone
Do you remember me? we were only fifteen
And I I remember the chorus
They were singing it for us
You were my september song
Tell me where have you gone
Do you remember me?
We were only fifteen
Sometimes I think that I see your
Face in the strangest of places
Down on the underground station passing by
I get a mad sense of danger
Feel like my heart couldn't take it
'Cause if we met we'd be strangers you and I
Still I play that mixtape every weekend
Got it repeating got it repeating
You were my september song
Summer lasted too long
Time moves so slowly when you're only fifteen
You were my september song
Tell me where have you gone?
Do you remember me? we were only fifteen
And I I remember the chorus
They were singing it for us
I hear that september song
And I'm singing along
Thinking about you and me
Oh what a melody
And as the years go by
You will still be my be my
September song
You are my
September song
You were my september song
Summer lasted too long
Time moves so slowly when you're only fifteen
You were my september song
Tell me where have you gone
Do you remember me? we were only fifteen

These coffee cups are getting cold
Mind the people passing by
They don't know I'll be leaving soon

I'll fly away tomorrow
To far away
I'll admit a cliche
Things won't be the same without you

I'll be looking at my window 
seeing Adelaide sky
Would you be kind enough to remember
I'll be hearing my own foot steps
under Adelaide sky
Would you be kind enough to remember me

I'll let you know what's on my mind
I wish they've made you portable
Then i'll carry you around and round
I bet you'll look good on me

I'll fly away tomorrow
It's been fun
I'll repeat the cliche
Things won't be the same without you

I'll be looking at my window 
seeing Adelaide sky
Would you be kind enough to remember
I'll be hearing my own foot steps
under Adelaide sky
Would you be kind enough to remember me

I've been meaning to call you soon
But we're in different times
You might not be home now
Would you take a message
I'll try to stay awake
And fight your presence in my head

I'll be looking at my window 
seeing Adelaide sky
Would you be kind enough to remember
I'll be hearing my own foot steps
under Adelaide sky
Would you be kind enough to remember me

I'll be looking at my window

Take what you must
The rest is all mine
Ooo cuz I can’t take away
What I didn’t say
I’m gonna leave it all behind

Stars collide and burst to life tonight

You can take all the sun away
Just because
Burn this page of the past away
Cuz you can’t take the one
The one that I love

In broken mirrors I’ve seen
I’ve seen a face that looks nothing like me
Ooo you can change the light
You can turn it all to black
But you can’t change memories

Silent tears fall from the sky tonight

You can take all the sun away
Just because
Burn this page of the past away
Cuz you can’t take the one
The one that I love

I can see, just what’s in front of me here
And I can’t explain so I won’t lose
No I won’t lose what I’ve gained no no"

I know the world is black and white
Tried to keep an open mind
but I just can't sleep on this tonight.
Stop this train
I wanna get off and go home again
I can't take the speed it's moving in
I know I can't but honestly
won't someone stop this train?
Don't know how else to say it
don't want to see my parents go
one generation's length away
from fighting life out on my own
Stop this train
I wanna get off and go home again
I can't take the speed it's moving in
I know I can't but honestly
won't someone stop this train?
So scared of getting older
I'm only good at being young
So I play the numbers game
to find a way to say that life has just begun
Had a talk with my old man
Said help me understand
he said turn 68
you'll renegotiate
don't stop this train
don't for a minute change the place you're in
don't think I couldn't ever understand
I tried my hand
John honestly we'll never stop this train.
Once in a while
when it's good
it'll feel like it should
And they're all still around
And you're still safe and sound
and you don't miss a thing
'Til you cry when you're
driving away in the dark
Singing stop this train
I wanna get off and go home again

I know I can't cause now I see
I'll never stop this train"

1232,Quiet Times,Dido(다이도),"Ask me where I go tonight I go back to today last year. 
Me and you had to make each other happier, now theres hope with everything.

Its hard enough to feel the world as it is and hold on anything. 
Without these quiet times you've brought round here.

Im Gonna have to run away, im sure that I belong some other place. 
I've seen another side of all I've seen it keeps me wondering where my family is.

Its hard enough to see the world as it is, and hold on anything. 
Without these quiet times coming round here.

Now I miss you...
Now I want you...
But I can't have you...
Even when your here...

Suppose I have to take you with me, broken mind I'd rather leave you here.
To forget everything you've seen and known erase every idea.

And you walk up in the street, and hold my hand and smile. 
Well I won't be taken in, cus I know how it turns out. 
And it takes me back to these quiet times coming round here.

Now I miss you...
Now I want you...
Your not coming back...
And I need you...
But I can't have you...
Even when your here...

Now I miss you...
Now I want you...
Your not coming back...

You cry over boys you haven't even met in real life
Yeah, you know he's the worst
But you tell all your friends he seems nice, oh-oh
You change like the seasons in LA
And by that I mean that you don't ever really even change
No, you just cry over boys you haven't even met in real life
Oh-oh

[Chorus]
How many nights can you spend
Staining your pillow with makeup?
When you're really upset
It's so annoying to take off
Just to do it again
Oh, what's the point in dressing up to be let down?

[Bridge]
Aren't you tired of getting hurt?
Aren't you sick of, of making it worse?

[Verse 2]
You cry over boys you know would never cry about you
He used to light up your room
Now your phone is darker than a tattoo, oh-oh
You move like the Earth around the stars
Broken-hearted when you end up in the same place that you start
No, back to crying over boys you know would never cry about you
Oh-oh


[Chorus]
How many nights can you spend
Staining your pillow with makeup?
When you're really upset
It's so annoying to take off
Just to do it again
Oh, what's the point in dressing up to be let down?

[Bridge]
Aren't you tired of getting hurt?
Aren't you sick of, of making it worse?

Yeah, when you gonna learn? (when you gonna learn?)
When you gonna learn?
When you gonna learn (how not to get hurt?)

For you baby)
You see I had a love song
It was all planned out
I wrote up a storm it was a real standout
Couldn't let my perfect ideas just go to waste
Guess my time ran out yeah
I had some clever ass lyrics
I felt like Kanye thought I was a genius
From the verses to the chorus
And the part with all the ad libs
It really had a lot of meaning
I really wish that you could hear it
Now there's no point in finishing I lost the spirit
Keep it in my drafts then one day
It'll disappear and whoa
And well I just wish
You knew what I was feeling
Oh I don't think you would understand
But I just wish that this song went
As planned yeah
I had a love song it was all planned out
I wrote up a storm it was a real standout
Couldn't let my perfect ideas just go to waste
Now I can't put it out
Lyrics in my head for days
I had something more to say
Wish you could read everything I've said
Pages go on and on 'cause you
Touch me in my spirit
Hit me with some meaning
I've been a mess for longer days
Listen to my heartstrings playing
Oh I don't think you would understand
I just wish that this song went as planned
You see I had a love song
It was all planned out
I wrote up a storm it was a real standout
Couldn't let my perfect ideas just go to waste
Guess my time ran out yeah
I had a love song for you baby
And my ideas really stood out
Though (For you baby)
But I ran out so
This is the outro yeah
I had a love song for you baby
And my ideas really stood out
Though (For you baby)
But I ran out so
This is the outro yeah

But life just ain't fair sometimes
That's what I realized
I'm hoping this is just
A blessing in disguise"
1246,Beautiful Mistakes,Maroon 5(마룬 파이브),"It's beautiful it's bittersweet
You're like a broken home to me
I take a shot of memories
And black out like an empty street
I fill my days with the way you walk
And fill my nights with broken dreams
I make up lies inside my head
Like one day you'll come back to me
Now I'm not holding on not holding on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holding on not holding on
Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head
She's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake
Makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back
I'm in love with the past

Nah nah nah in my head
Nah nah nah in my bed
Nah nah nah eh
Makin' beautiful mistakes
It's pitiful I can't believe
How every day gets worse for me
I take a break I cut you off
To keep myself from lookin' soft
I fill my nights with the way you was
And still wake up with broken dreams
I make these lies inside my head
Feel like they're my reality
Now I'm not holding on not holding on

Makin' beautiful mistakes
You did me wrong 'cause I let you
Usually I like my situations beneficial
Doin' something different
Got me lookin' stupid
The only way I'm comin' back to you is
If you're dreaming lucid
Prove it if you made a promise then keep it
Why you wanna lie and then get mad?
I don't believe it
But really I was doin' just fine without ya
Lookin' fine sippin' wine
Dancin' on club couches
Baby why you wanna lose me
Like you don't need me?
Like I don't block you
And you still try to reach me
How you figure out how to call me
From the TV?
You're runnin' outta chances
And this time I mean it
Yeah bet you miss my love all in your bed
Now you're stressin' out pulling your hair
Smelling your pillows and wishin' I was there
Slidin' down the shower wall lookin' sad
I know it's hard to let go I'm the best
Best you ever had and best you gon' get
And if we break up I don't wanna be friends
You're toxic
Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head
She's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake
Makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back
I'm in love with the past

And let the wind play with your hair
Blow the cobwebs from your mind
They’ve been keeping you so blind 

Didn’t you know?
There is so much that you can share

All the happiness
Don’t even hesitate
Oh, baby, make a brand new start

Once in a while you get so down
Baby, once in a while you feel the doubt

The obstacles that form reality
They are mere illusion
A bigger picture’s waiting here for you
So step back
Into a bright new world
A world of color and harmony 


Taking it slow
Just smell the fragrance in the air
Watch the clouds dance in the sky
Right before your very eyes 

Didn’t you know
That every single blade of grass
Is a miracle?

Don’t even hesitate
Oh, baby, make a brand new start 

Can’t navigate the ups and downs
No you can’t understand the ins and outs

The puzzles that confuse reality
They are mere illusion 
A bigger picture’s waiting here for you

So step back
Into a bright new world 
A world of color and harmony"

 Till you get in touch with monogamy

I thought it'd never faze me

By something I suppress

Two lovers on the loose
It's all about the way we pace it
Why can't we not simplify?
Just let it go and try
Shall we make shall we make the move?
Shall we make shall we make the move?
Shall we make shall we make the move?
Shall we make shall we make the move?
Photos and the camera never lie
There's nothing on the line to compromise
But I'm still afraid they'll never make it
Trying to cope with what I fantasize
You always find the words to break the ice
It's not like there's much for us
To complicate here

Two lovers on the loose
It's all about the way we pace it
Why can't we not simplify?
Just let it go and try
Shall we make shall we make the move?
Shall we make shall we make the move?
Shall we make shall we make the move?
Shall we make shall we make the move?
Come close time to do it right
With every step my legs are paralyzed
Can't believe your touch is electrified
With every day it gets intensified
I wanna be fine but god I need you
You're the calm when I try to pull through
Well anyway this feeling feels new
Well anyway this feeling feels new
You've been thinking 'bout it too
Two lovers on the loose
It's all about the way we pace it
Why can't we not simplify?

Cigarette smoke won't make you feel at home
Yesterdays are made for letting go
Silver will never feel like gold
And chasing shadows will leave you in the cold
Oh you should dance some more
Don't need nobody to take you home
Grab a drink or four
Don't need nobody to take you home
Oh there's a world outside for you to see
It's all beyond the borderline
Two empty souls won't fill the vacancy
You'll never know until you try
Shooting stars were made for you to see
Even clouds could use some company
Swimming in your sky of make believe
It's okay if you're lonely
Shit I get lonely too
Oh you should dance some more
Don't need nobody to take you home
Grab a drink or four
Don't need nobody to take you home
Now the floor is yours
Don't need nobody to call your phone
You better dance some more
Don't need nobody to take you home

Searching for the one to make me right
Wondering if she's the shade of you

Warning you stay away
If we meet at the rendezvous
Take me away sunray
Darling I got my trust issues
Warning you stay away
If we meet at the rendezvous
Take me away sunray
Time and toys
May fill my heart with joy

Silver and gold
New desire
Friends on fire
Call me 'lover boy'

1259,Sandals,Khai Dreams,"I love it when you say
What's really on your mind
No need to overwhelm yourself, there's always time to unwind
I wanna take a chance
Can't say I didn't try
I'm here for what I found, you're held up on what we left behind
The timing's never perfect, love, that's just what people say
When they think back to the moments not sweating the smaller things
Sometimes I feel regret, sometimes I wish that things would change
But sometimes is just sometimes and you know sometimes never stays


I love you all the same
It's just a situation
Don't let it get between what we want, yeah, what we could be
I love you more each day
Sometimes I can't explain it but I feel it and I don't want that to change
I'm just dreaming
I know you're thinking
That the summer left us behind
I'll be waiting
I might be crazy
But I think that it's worth my time


What was it that you lost?
Been chasing all this time?
I'll try to fill the gaps but I feel its a losing fight
I know it's not ideal
There's probably better ways
But this ain't my first time, although I've never been to this place
We're coming around
My heart starts to pound
From everything, all the possibilities
Ya know those things
Once dragged me down
But now they're a cloud
Where I can wait there patiently, because



I love you all the same
It's just a situation
Don't let it get between what we want, yeah, what we could be
I love you more each day
Sometimes I can't explain it but I feel it and I don't want that to change
I'm just dreaming
I know you're thinking
That the summer left us behind
I'll be waiting
I might be crazy
But I think that it's worth my time"
1260,Powerless,Mat Kearney(맷 카니),"Flashing floods, stuck in the mud
I was off the grid in all the ruts
Still felt so close from far away
Sun went down, lights went out
We built a fire, so strong now
And there's no words for what I want to say

[Chorus]
Lay me down here to sleep
To the sound of defeat
When it comes to us we're powerless
Powerless

[Verse 2]
Violent wind, blew down the door
Did me in and I prayed for more
All the damage done and I don't wanna change
No way

[Chorus]
Lay me down here to sleep
To the sound of defeat
When it comes to us we're powerless
Powerless


[Bridge]
One friend said
""Nothing's really set in stone
Another way of holding on
Find a way to let it go""
I don't remember what you said
But I remember what you meant
I remember how it felt
How it felt to loose control

Powerless
Powerless

Horoscope says that I'm psycho
Nothing to fill up my film rolls
Spend all my time on my pillow
And I don't know how to listen to my friends
They say I need a night to forget
But I think I'll just surrender to my bed
'Cause I need a night in my head
Nobody gets to know me
Guess I've been living low key
Lately I've been putting out the read receipts
Lately I've been feeling like a homebody
Nobody gets the old me
No need to touch my car keys
Lately I just follow all my friends stories
Lately I've been feeling like a homebody
Sundays I don't know where the time goes
Sleeping 'til two is my Bible
Lost in the internet blackhole

If I'm just dreaming then I'm hoping I can stay asleep
Know that no matter what
After the closing scene
I'll be the only one to love you in my dreams
Sometimes it feels like I'll never have enough of you
When you're around me you make every passing moment new
And when I'm not with you, I know you'll still agree
I'll be the only one to love you in my dreams
Oh my, I swear
I can't stop looking into those eyes
I'm lost, maybe I'm hypnotized
'Cause the way you look with these pink skies
As the sun drifts away tonight
Just hold tight
'Cause when you're in my arms, it feels right
You know there ain't no place I'd rather be
Just dance with me all night
'Cause baby nothing else feels like...
You, you, nothing feels like you, you
No, there ain't no place I'd rather be
Just dance with me all night
'Cause baby nothing else feels like you
I got that feeling like we're young and it's a summer fling
But I've been hurt enough to know I love you differently
I think I finally found someone who won't disagree
I'll be the only one you'll keep loving in your dreams
Oh my, I swear I can't stop looking into those eyes
I'm lost, maybe I'm hypnotized
'Cause the way you look with these pink skies
As the sun drifts away tonight
Just hold tight

Of all the stars in the sky that burn
You are the one to bring me back to earth
See you remind where I came from
So when you're done with work
Just hit me boy I'll slide
Mediate on you just for the high
Think we met before another life
So when you want a round two
I could meet you outside
You're killing me softly
Know that you love me
Maybe I'm honestly falling too soon

I can't wait to be home with you
We can sit by the fire feeling cozy and fine
When I'm finally home with you
Feelin' tired of my mind
Of the passing of the time
Many thoughts many lines
Feelin' lost feelin' blind
Every single day wearin' down on my frame
Broken down broken down
I'm broken down again
And I want to believe
The weather won't get to me
But I've been bruised
And I bleed all over everything
I wanna have a little peace
A little rest and relief
I wish I could be like
All the people that I see
But this cursin' of the ground make me
Feel like I can't breathe
'Cause I know I'm not alone
But it do feel like that sometimes
Yea I know I am beloved
But it do be like that sometimes
But I know that it won't be for long
Until I can finally see the throne
Until that time that
When my days are said and done
I'll sing this song
I can't wait to come home to you
I can't wait to be home with you
We can sit by the fire feeling cozy and fine
When I'm finally home with you
I'm really sick of all the nonsense
My body warring with my conscience
And I just wanna feel a little bit of love
In little ways that make me feel okay
I'm so aware of all my broken pieces
Scattered on the ground
I'm singing out of all my silent secrets
Can you hear the sound
I wish I could be like
All the people that I see
But maybe all the people
All around are like me
I know I'm not alone
But it do feel like that sometimes
I know I am beloved
But it do be like that sometimes
I know that it won't be for long
Until I can finally see the throne
Until that time that
When my days are said and done

 But there is something wrong with me

 Give me more
 I'm sorry now about it
 Give me more
 I'm more than that

 I've got blood and I've got love
 I am so damn happy to be awake
 Shake me up with pills to take
 Tell me why the bellyache

 Give me more
 I'm sorry now about it
 Give me more
 I'm broken down, forget it
 I'd like to be more
 And I want an orange tree

 If in ten days I'm not dead
 I will get on out and use my legs
 Run myself a clear green bath
 Keep the good times rolling
 And that my friends, is that"

I abused my kidneys

Then I'd get stoned and eat too much
I was kind of reckless
'Til I fell in love
Now I call my doctor every day
Since I met you something in me's changed
Second that you called me yours
I had something worth living for
Now I'm scared of planes and heart attacks
If I die I'll never get you back
You made me a hypochondriac
I used to drink like a sailor
If I had a weird pain I'd say a prayer
Used to need an inhaler
Any time I went up a flight of stairs
I'm not sayin' I'm perfect now
But you gave me something to think
About all the time
Glad I made you mine
Now I call my doctor every day
Since I met you something in me's changed
Second that you called me yours
I had something worth living for
Now I'm scared of planes and heart attacks

Red fingertips have lost there flame
Theres only darkness in your games
Now were chasing light again
All the words we left unsaid
Are painting heartbreak in my head
Turned the sunshine grey
Every feeling trying to bloom
From pink to red to ocean blue
Lost to winter again
Skys feel empty
And Life gets heavy
When Nothing good is left to save
Where does love go
When two Hearts turn cold
All the colors start to fade
When colors start to fade
Your sparkling shoes only dance to blues
That yellow dress don't fit your mood
Your black and white choose words
That bruise
Left me tangled and confused
All the words we left unsaid
Are painting heartbreak in my head
Turned the sunshine grey
Every feeling trying to bloom
From pink to red to ocean blue
Lost to winter again

Maybe I can dive but I won't
Cause I can't face the tide alone
Sitting on the edge of windows
Where we used to talk and you'd smoke
But now I'm up here on my own
Boxes full of years in empty rooms
The hardest thing is letting go of you
So you can
Keep my t shirts
For what it's worth
They look better on you anyway
These old photos
I'll keep them close
In case you wanna see them again
Someday
I know we haven't spoken in weeks
It's like we only meet in our sleep
And I can't wait to close my eyes
I found the missing earring you wore
The night you threw me out
And slammed the door
But you won't let me back this time
And now it haunts me
In these empty rooms
The hardest thing is letting go of you
So you can
Keep my t shirts
For what it's worth
They look better on you anyway
These old photos
I'll keep them close
In case you wanna see them again

Keep my t shirts
For what it's worth

what can I do
to help this world

He said, it’s really simple
just listen to my words
“give live and love
without expectations
and no limitations”

and with those words in my head
everything seemed to change

‘Cause all this time I’ve been blind
Have been selfish all was mine
What are we trying to get a kick out of
when all we need is time and love

Maybe love is all we need
understanding each other’s insecurities
and add some positivity
Maybe we are being ignorant
discovering so much about space
when we should be discovering ourselves

with those words in my head
everything seemed to change

‘Cause all this time I’ve been blind
Have been selfish all was mine
What are we trying to get a kick out of

And it doesn’t make a difference

1301,Nothing's the Same,Alexander 23,"[Verse 1: Jeremy Zucker]
You go ahead I think I'll stay in for the winter
Can't quite remember when I even got this bitter
And how do you live like that?
So uncomplicated by the weather in December, think I'll stay in for the winter

[Chorus: Alexander 23 & Jeremy Zucker]
Nothing's the same as it used to be
Even my friends can't talk to me
Used to have fun now we only get together
Nothing's the same as it was before
Lost track of time at the grocery storе
Wondering if I've felt this way forеver

[Post-Chorus: Jeremy Zucker]
It gets hard to remember
It gets hard to remember

[Verse 2: Alexander 23]
You go ahead you're probably better off without me
Just take a look at all the heartbreak that surrounds me
Oh, how do you live like that?
So at peace with all the war
Whatever, like I said you're probably better off without me

[Chorus: Alexander 23 & Jeremy Zucker]
Nothing's the same as it used to be
Even my friends can't talk to me
Used to have fun now we only get together
Nothing's the same as it was before
Lost track of time at the grocery store
Wondering if I've felt this way forever


[Post-Chorus: Alexander 23 & Jeremy Zucker]
It gets hard to remember
It gets hard to remember

[Break]

[Chorus: Jeremy Zucker, Alexander 23, Alexander 23 & Jeremy Zucker]
Nothing's the same as it used to be
Even my friends can't talk to me
Used to have fun now we only get together
Nothing's the same as it was before
Lost track of time at the grocery store
Wondering if I've felt this way forever

It gets hard to remember"
1302,Been Around,Cordae,"When you when you was in chicago still
Did you find yourself like as a lost boy?
Yep mmh
No mother
I think I could do better but I still
I want this forever
Uh sometimes life's about
The people you know
Watchin' a flower bloom
As its features will grow
I mean I never been
One to preach to them folks
I'm just speakin' from experience
My teachings is dope
Learning lessons with my brethren
Joy is quite contagious
Counting blessings on blessings
My heart right to make it
And it's kinda my only option
Maybe my decisions
Haven't really been the best
But this my life I'm livin'
Although it seem so bittersweet
When you ain't got nothing to eat
And sallie mae callin' your phone for like
The fifth time this week
All your bills overdue
All your bitches over you
Only one option remains
You just gotta show and prove
And so I know little darling
I know how the pain it hurts
Say something to me sweetie
We'll get through we'll make it work
'Cause I've been around
And you've caught me down bad I say
Next time in town
You're always welcome 'round my way
Uh so take risks and live spontaneous
I'm so insane
But that's the shit that make me rich
And why we love the game
And to my various enemies
Who carrying energy
Of greed and envy
Just know I love you for centuries
So all is forgiven animosity for none
'Cause I done been through a lot
Thankful who I have become
I done lost a couple brothers
Dead cousins on the regular
But I ain't even stressing
Count my blessings know we headed up
I dropped out of school
Pops thinkin' I'm a fool
It may seem all cool but I'm feelin' awful
I was down in the dumps
With my confidence gone
But then my whole life changed
Droppin' prominent songs
And so I know little darling
I know how the pain it hurts
Say something to me sweetie
We'll get through we'll make it work
'Cause I've been around
And you've caught me down bad I say
Next time in town
You're always welcome 'round my way"

In between

Say that I want commitment free cos (Cause)
Waking up in someone else's bed
Ain't good for me

1305,sunny days,Virginia To Vegas(버지니아 투 베가스),"Oh, everybody knows
 February's meant for getting high and staying home
 And when the sky turns dark again
 It always feels like midnight but it's only 4PM

 Long time since I've seen my best friends
 Fun times out there in the west end

 Sunny days in the cold
 Sunny days, sunny days in the cold
 Sometimes all that it takes
 Is one little taste
 Watch the snow melt away
 As the winter changes lanes
 Sunny days, I don't feel so alone
 Sunny days, sunny days in the cold

 Oh, every now and then
 City girls in summer clothes are coming out again
 I want to soak it up before it's gone
 And find someone to hold until the next one comes along

 So long since I've seen my best friends
 Fun times out there in the west end

 Sunny days in the cold
 Sunny days, sunny days in the cold
 Sometimes all that it takes
 Is one little taste
 Watch the snow melt away
 As the winter changes lanes
 Sunny days, I don't feel so alone
 Sunny days, sunny days in the cold

 Sunny days in the cold
 Sunny days, sunny days in the cold
 Sometimes all that it takes
 Is one little taste
 Watch the snow melt away
 As the winter changes lanes
 Sunny days, I don't feel so alone

1307,Video,India.Arie(인디아 아리),"Sometimes I shave my legs and sometimes I don't' 
Sometimes I comb my hair and sometimes I won't 
Depending on how the wind blows 
I might even paint my toes 
It really just depends on whatever feels good in my soul 

I'm not the average girl from your video 
And I ain't built like supermodel 
But I learned to love myself unconditionally 
Because I am a queen 
I'm not the average girl from your video 
My worth is not determined by the price of my clothes 
No matter what I'm wearing I will allways be India Arie 

When I look in the mirror the only one there is me 
Every freckle on my face is where it's supposed to be 
And I know our creator didn't make no mistakes on me 
My feet My thighs My lips My eyes I'm loving what I see 

I'm not the average girl from your video 
And I ain't built like supermodel 
But I learned to love myself unconditionally 
Because I am a queen 
I'm not the average girl from your video 
My worth is not determined by the price of my clothes 
No matter what I'm wearing I will allways be India Arie 

Am I less of lady if I don't wear pantyhose 
My mama said a lady ain't what she wears 
but what she knows 
But I've drawn the conclustion it's all an illusion 
Confusions the name of the game 
A misconception a mass deception 
Something's got to change 
Don't be offended this all my opinion 
Ain't nothing that I'm say law 
This is a true confession of a life learned lesson 
I was sent here to share with y'all 
So get in where you fit in 
Go on and shine Clear your mind now's the time 
Put this all on the shelf go on and love yourself 
Cause everything's gonna be alright 

I'm not the average girl from your video 
And I ain't built like supermodel 
But I learned to love myself unconditionally 
Because I am a queen 
I'm not the average girl from your video 
My worth is not determined by the price of my clothes 
No matter what I'm wearing I will allways be India Arie 

Keep your fancy drinks and your expensive minks 
I don't need that to have a good time 
Keep your expensive car and your caviar 
All i need is my guitar 
Keep your Cristal and your pistol 
I'd rather have a pretty piece crystal 
Don't need your silly cone I prefer my own 
What Gog gave me is just fine 

I'm not the average girl from your video 
And I ain't built like supermodel 
But I learned to love myself unconditionally 
Because I am a queen 
I'm not the average girl from your video 
My worth is not determined by the price of my clothes

1308,You've Got A Friend,Joanna Wang(조안나 왕/王若琳),"When you're down and troubled
And you need some love and care
And nothing, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me
And soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest night

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there
You've got a friend

If the sky above you
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind begins to blow
Keep your head together
And call my name out loud
Soon you'll hear me knocking at your door

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there, yes, I will

 Ain't it good to know that you've got a friend
When people can be so cold?
They'll hurt you and desert you
And take your soul if you let them, don't you let them

You just call out my name
And you know wherever I am
I'll come running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there, yes, I will
You've got a friend
You've got a friend
You've got a friend
You've got a friend"

To tell you the truth
I just want you to be happy
But I don't wanna have to see it
Maybe I'll see you in passing
And we can pretend this is easy
Keep my eyes close so you won't know
I'm falling apart hanging onto your ghost
I just want you to be happy
But I don't wanna have to see it
The reality is Hard to admit
But we didn't work well
So please live your life
I'll keep you in mind
Just like I promised that I would
Oh when I see you holding on to
Somebody new
I wont know what to do

But I don't wanna have to see it

Time's a finite thing
And so are me and you
Can't say that I'm not glad
To have
Somebody to hold
Someone I know
Will see me through the night
And I don't even have to try
Guess I can't lie
If that somebody is you
You were never patient
But I can't blame you
Time's a finite thing
And so are me and you
Can't say that I'm not glad

침대에서 내게 말했죠
my minds got deeper 
내 생각들이 더 깊어져서
so you say you can’t reach it no more 
당신은 더이상 닿을 수 없다고 했어요

I hate when I have to be there to do stuffs you'd want me to 
난 당신이 원하는 걸 하러 가야 한다는 게 싫어요 
You know I have something to do, Since I wasn’t the girl that you knew
내가 변한 이후로는 당신도 내가 할 일이 있다는 걸 알 텐데
Let’s not talk about that, In front of lives ahead 
그냥 이런 얘기하지 말아요, 앞으로의 삶 앞에서
Changes are many 
변화는 너무도 많지만
But steady things are dead 
변함없는 건 다 죽었어요


Can’t be what you want 
당신이 원하는 게 될 수 없고
I can’t be what you were 
난 당신처럼 될 수 없어요

내가 많은 것을 해냈다고 할 순 없지만, 지금은
Can’t be good enough 
충분히 잘하는 건 할 수 없어요 
Can’t say we'll be done well
우리가 잘 끝날 거라고 말할 수 없지만
Don’t say what you want 
당신이 원하는 걸 말하지 마요


I’m not a bird anymore
난 더이상 새가 아니에요
Since you set me free to leave 
당신이 날 자유롭게 놓아준 후로 
My heart wants to fly 
내 마음이 날고 싶어해요
So you can’t grab me no more
당신이 더이상 날 붙잡지 못하도록

I hate when I can’t do the things what my minds want me to do 
내 마음이 내게 원하는 일들을 못한다는 게 싫어요
You use that to save your heart 
당신은 그걸 이용해 당신 마음을 지키죠
Since I am not the girl that you want
난 당신이 원하는 소녀가 아니기에
Don’t let me down again 
또 실망시키지 말아요
and you should play it fair
공평하게 해야죠 
Changes are hurting 
변화는 아프지만
But steady things don’t stay 
변함없는 건 머물지 않아요


Can’t be what you want 
당신이 원하는 게 될 수 없고
I can’t be what you were

We had zero cares at all
It was la-la-la-la-la, la-la, alright
Then you left me this spring
Grabbed your clothes and packed your things
It was na-na-na-na-na, hey, hey, goodbye

[Verse 1]
Baby, in the middle of the winter we'd sleep in
Give you something warm
To put around your shoulders when you're cold
And later in the summer take the boat and go skiing
Dry you off when you'd get out the lake
And talk about the houses we'd buy when we're old

[Pre-Chorus]
And at that time
I thought we wеre doing just fine
I thought you werе really just mine
But just I thought it was...

Baby, in the middle of the autumn I'd tell you
You were everything I ever wanted
And I never wanted more than you
But minutes into saying it it's like already I knew
That something bad was coming

Things were never gonna feel this new

I thought we were doing just fine
I thought you were really just mine
But just I thought it was...

When we both met last fall
We had zero cares at all
It was la-la-la-la-la, la-la, alright
Then you left me this spring
Grabbed your clothes and packed your things
It was na-na-na-na-na, hey, hey, goodbye

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
When we both met last fall
We had zero cares at all
It was la-la-la-la-la, la-la, alright
Baby, you left me this spring
Grabbed your clothes and packed your things
It was na-na-na-na-na, hey, hey, goodbye"
1320,Smile,Johnny Stimson,"When my heads is full of questions
And the sky is full of rain
When I'm worrying about
What I can't change
I take a look in my reflection
And try to make a funny face
And for a second all my sorrows melt away
'Cause if we just smile
We can forget all of our troubles for a while
We can just live inside this moment
You and I get through the darkness
Knowing we'll find the light
If we just smile
If we just if we just
If we just smile
Yeah if we just smile
Maybe we focus on the future
No use in living in the past
Try to remember that
The bad times never last
And if we take one step
One step at a time
We're gonna make it
Gonna make it alright
If we stick together we'll be fine
'Cause if we just smile
We can forget all of our troubles for a while
We can just live inside this moment
You and I get through the darkness
Knowing we'll find the light
If we just smile
If we just if we just
If we just smile when the sky is falling
Smile when the love comes calling
We can take tomorrow on with style
If we just smile
We can forget all of our troubles for a while
Yeah we can just live inside this moment
You and I get through the darkness
Knowing we'll find the light
If we just smile
If we just if we just
If we just smile
Yeah if we just smile
If we just smile
Yeah if we just smile
If we just smile"

정말 궁금한데 말이야
i can never seem to get myself standing up straight 
나는 영원히 자신이 없을 것 같아
i thought that i had more time
시간이 좀 더 있다고 생각했었거든
yeah, it’s so hard to watch the clock ticking away
요란하게 흘러가는 시간을 지켜보는 게 힘들어
when will i finally feel like
언제쯤 나는 모든 게
everything will be alright?
괜찮아질 거라 느낄까?
i don’t know but it’s okay
잘 모르겠지만 괜찮아
no time to worry anyway
걱정할 시간도 없으니까
sometimes i miss those dreamy days
가끔 난 신경쓸 게 없던 날들이 그리워
when i didn’t care, now nothing’s the same
지금은 모든 게 달라졌지
no, i can’t get lost out in the past

넌 내게 마음대로 살라고 말해
yeah, i kinda wanna, but i’m thinking bigger now
뭐, 나도 그러고 싶지만 더 크게 생각하는 거야
bigger now

And a little bit of mine
There's nothing I can say
To change your mind
So while I got you in your room
Forgive me if it is too soon
But before you walk away
I got a few more things to say
Would it bother you
If I was looking 'round
For somebody else?
Would it bother you
If I was sleeping with someone
And not by myself? ooh
Kiss another girl slowly yeah
While I'm taking my time
If I was doing just fine
Would it bother you bother you?
And baby now you're gone
I can have that bottle of rum
'Cause you're not here to try
And change my mind
Just go ahead and turn the key
Just go ahead and set me free
Baby as you drive away
I only got one thing to say yeah
Would it bother you
If I was looking 'round
For somebody else?
Would it bother you
If I was sleeping with someone
And not by myself? ooh
Kiss another girl slowly yeah
While I'm taking my time
If I was doing just fine
Would it bother you bother you?
Yeah yeah
Would it bother you? mmh

With feeling helpless
I know it's not healthy
And I know that it's hard

And hoping that it kills me
I can see on my face in the mirror
I'm not happy and
I I I'm gonna need some help
And I I I haven't been myself
I've been drinkin' too much
Smokin' all night
Messing with the wrong girls
Nothing feels right
Every time I go out
Someone wants to pick a fight
Spend all of my money
I guess my momma was right yeah
I I I'm gonna need some help
I've had decent luck
At hiding all this darkness inside me
And I wish on every star
That one day I can stop
I think I've had enough
I've been hurtin' takin' in this pain
And hoping that it kills me
I can see on my face in the mirror
I'm not happy and

All of a sudden I'm there at that gate?
The end of my life no time for goodbyes
And I didn't get to try everything twice
I'd say Why'd it have to be me?
Why'd I have to go like this?
Know we hardly ever speak
But you could've given me notice
So thank God it's all in my head
'Cause I ain't done breathing just yet
I hope I don't go before it's my time
Before I can show what I'll do with my life
My wife would be sad and keep asking why
My mom would be mad
'Cause that's just what she's like
But I hope that someone remembers me well
That my messed up stories
Are good ones to tell
Don't get to decide but if I did
I wouldn't die before I got to live
I wanna know what it's like
To see 91 candles alight
Surrounded by the people who still love me
Even though I've never looked so ugly
It's the end of my life and that's fine
At least I could say my goodbyes
I hope I don't go before it's my time
Before I can show what I'll do with my life
My wife would be sad and keep asking why
My mom would be mad
'Cause that's just what she's like
But I hope that someone remembers me well
That my messed up stories are
Good ones to tell
Don't get to decide but if I did
I wouldn't die before I got to live
Before I got to live

 It's a light, it's a healin'

Saw a different side of me

At first I thought that he was just a friend
But then I heard that you were loving him
You broke my heart and
I don't really think that you mind
Build me up and turn me on
You played me like your favorite song
But I guess that you were never really mine
You made me feel like I was yours
you made me feel so insecure
But I guess that you were never really mine
Woo oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
Oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
So crossed my heart and hope to die
Never date a girl like you
After all the shit you put me through
Yeah all you ever did was lie
(pants on fire pants on fire)
Guess you can't find love in Mollywood
No you can't find love
when you're searching for better
Hope you find something better
either way it's whatever (uhh huh oh yeah)

it aint no thing we been friends for a awhile now
I love how we kick it and we do it all the time
and I love every minute livit like we both were dyin now
we both said that wed stay friends forever
and everyone asks me when well ever get together
and what I say back
Is that its not like that

I'd rather be your friend
than your nothin at all
thats why I cant tell you
how I really feel
I dont wanna risk it all my thoughts
will remain thoughts

I believe we can be the epitome 
of two in love I believe in possibilities
and were just best friends but the chemistry says to me
that were in love and meant to be
and you might feel the same or the opposite
or you might feel a little or a lot of it
or you might be
waiting for me 

I'd rather be your friend
than your nothin at all
thats why I cant tell you
how I really feel
I dont wanna risk it all my thoughts
will remain thoughts

I seen you at the top and I seen you at the bottom
and it breaks my heart to hear 
you talk about your guys problems
so I keep my options open 
even though my thoughts are broken
and all these thoughts keep pokin 
my emotions I keep hopin
that one day I'll ask you and you ll say “finally”
or maybe one day I'll pass you 
and you wont say hi to me
or lie to me say bye to me 
or tell me that your vibin me
and all of these thoughts keep 
eatin whats inside of me
you sleep on my lap and I sleep on your bed 
and its no big deal to your mom and your dad
cause I stay on my side and you stay on yours
and they know were just friends 
they even let yo close the door
and the more that I'm with you the more that I wanna
go through all the drama and finally tell my momma
that I told her that I love her 
and I know that theres no other
after all they say that 
best friends make the best lovers

I'd rather be your friend
than your nothin at all
thats why I cant tell you
how I really feel
I dont wanna risk it all my thoughts
will remain thoughts

I'd rather be your friend
than your nothin at all
thats why I cant tell you
how I really feel
I dont wanna risk it all my thoughts
will remain thoughts"
1332,Something bout That Feeling,Devin Kennedy,"When it feels like 
I've been fading to the background
Don't leave my room for like a week, 
don't wanna go out
But all these moments 
keep me reminding me of just how
Just how you can't have the high's 
without the letdowns
I overcomplicate
I underestimate
How easy it is to live like this
Feel better if I take my time
Just a second and I'll be alright
I know that there's a love that's gonna find me
There's something 'bout that feeling
There's something 'bout that feeling
There's something 'bout that feeling
There's something 'bout that feeling
Outside, the rain's done dancing 
with the storm clouds
But inside, there's not a dry eye 
in this whole house
And it ain't sadness 
why these tears keep falling down now
I know I'm not alone, 
I just get caught up in myself
I overcomplicate
I underestimate
I know that there's a love that's gonna find me
There's something 'bout that feeling
There's something 'bout that feeling
There's something 'bout that feeling
There's something 'bout that feeling
There's something 'bout that feeling
There's something 'bout that feeling
There's something 'bout that feeling
There's something 'bout that feeling"
